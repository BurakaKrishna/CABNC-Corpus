PS0X8|Over at Basingstoke and I had a look in the shoe shops and that they would be very handy for me erm lace up though.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|but these were are all crumped and I don't want clumsy ones cos you feel as though you've got Doctor Marten's or something on you know.
PS0X9|But they're not comfortable after a while.
PS0X8|and they look it though they look it that you know they really do.
PS0X9|All fuddy duddy.
PS0X8|Yeah yeah and they're sort of grey I'm not sure if she got them in a charity I'm certainly sure it wasn't bought in a shoe shop cos she goes round every charity she won't go in you know I told you about that oh I don't know what it is she said it's loaded out with stuff and we'll have to have a walk round there erm round by what was Kennedy's erm.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|by the bingo hall.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|that was a fruit shop she said it's loaded out as a cheap shop she said and erm she won't go in there because bloke's stood in there she said she don't mind going in and paying fifty because well they don't do that do they.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X8|you know so erm.
PS0X9|Yeah but he's only watching the.
PS0X8|well he's probably got nowhere else to go I mean it's.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X8|just aged off in n it there must be an out place but you wouldn't er.
PS0X9|I wouldn't leave them.
PS0X8|No you wouldn't leave it but she said it's a cheap shop so but she said there's loads.
PS0X9|but I've got to go to job spot one time.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|so when we walk round.
PS0X8|Yeah yeah that's right but I mean just go and have a look and I actually said to her well you'd be better with somebody else you know not going in there on your own.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|and erm you know she she obviously needs somebody else with her to make it not so obvious for her.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|not.
PS0X8|but I think that that with what it is you know but then I say she's got that anyway she's not as as tough as what she makes out but er it would be worth having a look you never know what's in there and I say I must pick up a couple of paper towels.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|I'm not I'm not gon na pay any more than that.
PS0X9|There's no point in it.
PS0X8|No oh I know what I never got that ain't finished I'll have to go down the shops I might go down.
PS0X9|What.
PS0X8|I didn't get that baby card did I.
PS0X9|You don't know whether.
PS0X8|I looked.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X8|I di last night when I was up there and he said to me what was that noise I went through all the piles and I had a quick look in the bureau but I didn't find that I don't know what I've done with that.
PS0X9|I know there was a baby one you know that erm pile with all different cards.
PS0X8|And there was a baby one in there.
PS0X9|I'm sure there was I'll go and have a look.
PS0X8|There was get wells and driving test oh have a look because I mean.
PS0X9|I'm sure there's one there.

PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|because I said it was erm Simon's and then I didn't know really where they lived and erm I know they moved out out of next door to Lesley's and in the end it never got done that that more to the point but erm I can't do that up until I've done that can I Well I can't do that up until the coat's ready anyway.
PS0X9|Oh yeah.
PS0X8|but erm that.
PS0X9|what shall we do with that then.
PS0X8|Oh I don't know I mean it's gon na go through there well I suppose I'm sure I can get some round the neck.
PS0X9|It won't fit round the neck.
PS0X8|Got to fix it then haven't you You'll want somewhere where you can either have it hanging.
PS0X9|Well no what did I do with that one for erm Ian and Diane.
PS0X8|might get it through the bottom that'll be simpler won't it I don't know what's gon na be simplest.
PS0X9|When I did that one for Ian we just tied it in at the back didn't we.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|And had that.
PS0X8|well let it dry off for a minute well they must have a card good job I thought about that I should be interested to see what she calls her because I think Annalise is a beautiful name.

PS0X9|some something like that and they used to call her Neen.
PS0X8|Oh.

PS0X8|and erm he's got in the in the fabric one he's got double doors and all the rolls of carpet and erm he's got a table in there and obviously to make a cup of tea got a couple of beds in there cos he's sold them and it's like a big warehouse and erm all around there there's a big concreted area you know and er all these units and that's where we we reckon it is I mean there's a lot there there's a lot of.
PS0X9|Places.
PS0X8|places yeah no no the evening one would be a doddle Anyway we'll wait and see might not occur I mean if then if you did then the the.

PS0X9|I'll have a temporary job.
PS0X8|Ah.

PS0X9|Oh I'll try a pair of yours on.
PS0X8|Yeah but they're stretchies that's what's so nice about them.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|and the material is you feel the stretch the others are like this and they just sit there but then in the end they ride up you see.
PS0X9|They bag.
PS0X8|Oh they bag something terrible but then I say at the price I'm not gon na buy them I'm not but in the Dodger's there's not one small in any colour.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X8|well then if I go onto a medium then you're getting all this length and all this business here all that business and it's too much if I could of found a four I'd certainly tried it on for swimming you know but I don't want it all baggy and horrible you know.
PS0X8|and I do like that sewing stripe down the middle.

PS0X8|well no I'm only wearing me bloody coat and the skirt and er grey tights that's all er whatever up top I mean I hope that have a look I hope it's gon na be a better bus anyway this week.
PS0X9|Make sure that hip's on the side then.
PS0X8|I've already got one I'm not bothered about that I mean for kids I think I think it's a good idea because well then they don't lay on it.
PS0X9|Oh I've done that for many a year.
PS0X8|Yeah oh it is neater I agree with that I just want to get on with it now.
PS0X9|You're not happy with it are you.

PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|I mean it came out well I thought it came out very well considering it was you know different process and it certainly does the job and I still haven't got my damn postcards have I.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X9|yeah I would I've got to write to Dot tomorrow.
PS0X8|Yeah yeah.
PS0X9|cos I think it's only fair.
PS0X8|I've got that card I think it's in there.
PS0X8|oh no well I mean I think you've got to do it properly I don't think you should do it on the caravan because A you're gon na get the reception B you're gon na have to make an appointment and it in a letter.
PS0X9|I'll probably have to see them anyway.
PS0X8|Sorry.
PS0X9|I'll probably have to go up to them.
PS0X8|Well you probably shall well that's well that's their choice then not yours.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|but the whole point is you can put down every detail in a letter for them to read to put on file can't you No I think you should do it do it that way round.
PS0X9|Well I'll pop up there first then.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|even if I'm not.
PS0X8|I'll give them a ring tomorrow.
PS0X9|Yeah.

PS0X8|She might of had hers by now mightn't she.
PS0X9|Yeah whoops big.
PS0X9|oh big foot.
PS0X8|Well she might be that little bit further on let's face it I mean.
PS0X9|Yeah I could.
PS0X8|Well otherwise you might be you know a little bit further but.
PS0X9|I wonder whether how long it's gon na take Martin to fit that gear if Martin can do it.
PS0X8|Well I want now I want yeah well I understand but I wonder how long since they will leave it she's already looked for an answ you know she doesn't get an answer that's the point I should think by now he'd.
PS0X8|I can't see I mean of course I mean she can take him to court over the money.
PS0X9|Mm.
PS0X8|if he disagrees or don't do anything but I can't see how he can't leave it can be without it has to know.
PS0X9|Oh I'd.
