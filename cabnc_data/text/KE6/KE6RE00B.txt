PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|I don't know how they did it in the end but.
PS0X9|Mm.
PS0X8|well it certainly was spectacular though.

PS0X9|Eh.
PS0X8|Pretty busy in that restaurant.

PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|but.
PS0X9|really have you.
PS0X8|Can't can I go on me own.
PS0X9|Of course you can.

PS0X9|stuck he's stuck again isn't he.
PS0X9|oh you might get him interested in different things.
PS0X8|Ha what.
PS0X9|you never know.
PS0X8|Could do.
PS0X9|you're never too old to change.
PS0X8|I'm not so sure about that one.
PS0X9|Oh well oh dear.
PS0X8|It was good weren't it.
PS0X9|It's brilliant.
PS0X8|But er Helen she missed the best one ah It was better than the other one it might of been the seats but I don't think so because I mean there was so much in this one.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|I mean the other was a nice story but I think this year's is better.
PS0X9|more for the show.
PS0X8|Yeah it was more of a show than a story weren't it But there was something.
PS0X9|It brought you to the place and then.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and then it just it.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|erupted.
PS0X8|Yeah it did my feet ache now.
PS0X9|My feet are aching now I've got thick tights on.
PS0X9|shoes.
PS0X8|I know.
PS0X8|but I didn't know how cold it'll be but.
PS0X9|That's not a brilliant idea.
PS0X8|you see no it isn't a brilliant idea but the thing is we didn't have much further to walk can we.
PS0X9|Yes.
PS0X8|We could of done.
PS0X8|the what.
PS0X9|I think.
PS0X8|yeah you are great.
PS0X8|oh I put my half off I doubt if I get my feet back in them but yeah.
PS0X8|oh dear.
PS0X8|ah so you are sure you will sure you will.
PS0X9|Then I can sew it up and I've only got the.
PS0X8|One sleeve oh.
PS0X9|one sleeve.
PS0X8|it's gon na be a good one you know.
PS0X9|I hope so.
PS0X8|I can see it you know it looks it right.
PS0X9|When it gets the toggles on it should be okay.
PS0X8|The what.
PS0X9|When it gets the toggles on it should be okay.
PS0X8|Yeah but it looks like it's gon na be good some of them.
PS0X9|I don't know what one to do next really.
PS0X8|Well you'll have to decide I mean you.
PS0X9|I think I'll do another plain one but this one some were plain.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|but.
PS0X8|mm.
PS0X9|erm that chunky one.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|it's not just plain there's so many stitches erm stocking stitch and so many rib.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|so.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|it'll have some pattern but not.
PS0X8|terrific amount.
PS0X9|a terrific.
PS0X8|mm.
PS0X9|cos it has two bands of rib.
PS0X8|Yeah oh oh oh god well.
PS0X9|Then you can help me unpick it.
PS0X8|Well that won't take long to unpick it will it.
PS0X9|No it hadn't been knitted up too long.
PS0X8|No.
PS0X9|that's what I don't want for it to er.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|crinkle too quickly.
PS0X8|Yeah anyway once it's washed it's all gone anyway.
PS0X9|Oh yeah.
PS0X8|so really that's not a problem.
PS0X9|No but as you I'll use that what's not a.
PS0X8|ha ha I bet you will it won't take that long to unpick it though but I mean you've got a quite a selection there to choose haven't you.
PS0X9|Yeah oh if I can undo that one then I can do the sleeve.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|cos that'll be quite.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|that will be quite intra intricate.
PS0X8|Yeah not much bigger job anyway in n it.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|Well I'll look I'll see how much of that plum is left.
PS0X9|I think there's quite a lot of plum and.
PS0X8|you can't use that much can you.
PS0X9|I think it was two balls.
PS0X8|Plenty then in n it For that and.
PS0X9|and you've got two well what was in them You would of got two cos you would of been a big one won't you Just that colour.
PS0X8|That's right but I mean all I want it for is the erm.
PS0X9|Body.
PS0X8|the body and use the black.
PS0X9|Two black feet.
PS0X8|That's right I think it looked very effective what that woman had on.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|so.
PS0X9|can do one like that with that mustard up the top shelf.
PS0X8|Yeah it's nice in n it.
PS0X9|with the black.
PS0X8|That would stand out wouldn't it.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|That would be nice you won't want that much for the sleeve.
PS0X8|of black so do anything with black for ages.
PS0X9|I saw your Andrew the other day.
PS0X8|Eh.
PS0X9|I would think Andrew doing some.
PS0X8|Probably would.
PS0X9|three pound balls and three pound thirty er three pound twenty seven.
PS0X8|How much was it nine Yeah it was nine that's right no it could be quite interesting actually and then the other way.
PS0X9|Or then you'd do like the four four four flares.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|flat back.
PS0X8|Yeah it's limitless in n it but the other way is to do right down the centre one on one and one on the other.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|reverse it on the back or have the same on the back.
PS0X9|No what what you normally do with those is er say one half black and one half yellow and you have a yellow sleeve that side.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and a black sleeve that side.
PS0X8|that's right limitless in n it But it would be wise to use the plum before I got the cerise or the sea green.
PS0X9|Well it would.
PS0X8|Yeah of course it would well it only sat there anyway again in n it.
PS0X9|Of course it does.
PS0X9|haven't we.
PS0X8|Well we always do I mean if you'd use all that was in that cupboard you'd have half a dozen jumpers.
PS0X9|I know.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|Well I shall use the mohair next.
PS0X8|Yeah well there must be a fair amount of mohair.
PS0X9|There is.
PS0X8|I mean that was an exceptionally good buy weren't it.
PS0X9|Well what I want is the black and the cerise.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|because I'm not sure whether to put all different colours in.
PS0X8|Well I think I'd just experiment.
PS0X9|or the black and the cerise and all the jacquards.
PS0X8|but you must yeah.
PS0X9|because that could be quite effective.
PS0X8|That would be effective but I mean you don't want to do any that you've got to unpick no that.
PS0X8|is not viable that.
PS0X9|Yeah that's why I think if I did all the jacquard in the cerise.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|that would show up beautiful.
PS0X8|Mm yeah I think it would.
PS0X9|because what they've done on that pattern why they've got so many different colours where it mixes so you've got your red and your.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|green they've got like an orangey.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|you know where it crosses.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|you know like that one of Howard's jumper.
PS0X8|Yeah yeah.
PS0X9|well they've got it so that the colours in the middle.
PS0X8|Sort of mingle.
PS0X9|mingle.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and like you've sort of got a yellow and a green they've put like an olive in that an olive colour but I haven't got colours that I can.
PS0X8|No.
PS0X9|mix like that.
PS0X8|not like that no.
PS0X9|No that's the thing.
PS0X8|Oh well oh as long as you don't have to unpick because that is awful.
PS0X9|Oh I know.
PS0X8|It's just a mess in n it after.
PS0X9|Yeah but I don't know it'll be quite effective.
PS0X8|Yeah oh yeah but as I say it's limitless really.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|especially with a.
PS0X9|unless I go up that shop top shop and have a look at those gramme balls yellow oranges.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|red and got those to put in the black.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|but there again my er.
PS0X8|How much were they.
PS0X9|Ninety nine P.
PS0X8|Oh that's not so bad is it.
PS0X9|No but there again.
PS0X8|But there again you're buying again.
PS0X9|Well I'd put in the cerise and have all the jacquard colours it it would look very effective.
PS0X8|Mm it certainly would it doesn't have to be different colours.
PS0X9|No no it doesn't how many black ones are there.
PS0X8|I can't remember.
PS0X9|Two.
PS0X8|No I don't think there was two.
PS0X9|No just one.
PS0X8|I think there was only one because they only had one and I got one white cos they only had one I think it was the other colours I'm sure I'd got two of I must of done cos I mean I've used a lot myself don't I.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|No I I would think the black and the white were one but mind you it goes a long blinking way don't it.
PS0X9|Well I.
PS0X8|yeah but I think it was only one and one of those two I I'd picked the white up because there wasn't any black for that first time.
PS0X9|Mm.
PS0X8|because I thought that was neutral didn't I.
PS0X9|Erm.
PS0X8|I don't know if I had them or not.
PS0X9|I wonder if I've seen one of those.
PS0X8|Three hundred again I think it was it was six balls weren't it Two four six.
PS0X9|but they want seven and I want to put that big bit at the bottom.
PS0X8|Have I used any black I haven't have I.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X8|No.
PS0X9|Or was it seventy five ball.
PS0X8|I du n no.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X8|I think it was fifty I do but I'm not sure oh perhaps if we can get over there at the end of the well it's the end of the month next week anyway in n it.
PS0X9|Oh.
PS0X8|I mean you don't know what they've got over there now do you I mean basically we go there and the meat shop don't we.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|There's not much else we want to look around at is there.
PS0X9|We wan na look at shoes.
PS0X8|Shoes I.
PS0X8|yeah.
PS0X9|But then again it's not a brilliant idea going on a.
PS0X9|for wool when we've got so many.
PS0X8|Oh yeah.
PS0X9|cos we'll come back loaded up.
PS0X8|haven't got it right actually I mean basically we can go up the top shop and buy what we like can't we Get one O nine I mean providing you've got enough to do what you want to do in mohair.
PS0X9|I don't know.
PS0X8|no you'd have to get all out and have a look but I mean if I go over there I'll bring back a load of D K and I know I will we'll see.
PS0X9|Well you see the trouble is when we're buying it over there right.
PS0X8|You get the left overs.
PS0X9|we buy six hundred.
PS0X8|Six hundred yeah.
PS0X9|which is two hundred per person.
PS0X8|Yeah well you see it's quite a point you know cos if we go up the top shop we just well the most I would buy is four.
PS0X9|Well that's four pound four pound.
PS0X8|Well that's what four pound and four nines.
PS0X9|Forty.
PS0X8|thirty six.
PS0X9|Four pound thirty six where you'd pay two pounds four pounds for two hundred grammes.
PS0X8|mm du n no well we'll see anyway it depends on you and what you're doing.
PS0X9|But there again it's better wool that you're buying from the.
PS0X8|What at the top shop.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X9|yeah.
PS0X8|Yeah that's a very old make you know that one's been going for donkey years but it's those colours I mean there's at least well with the o.
PS0X9|Well the trouble is we go over there and we buy a good buy.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|but it might not be the colours that we're actually looking for.
PS0X8|Well I I'm sure it wouldn't be what did I say I said that sea green and the cerise.
PS0X9|And I said the mustard.
PS0X8|The mustard and the beigey one weren't it.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|Er oatmeal.
PS0X9|Er yeah.
PS0X8|Well that's that's two jumpers each in n it.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|I mean I've got plenty of black so mustard and black whatever whatever cerise and black or something that's daft really you know.
PS0X9|It's very silly.
PS0X8|I mean nine times out of ten we erm we just go over there and buy what's there.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|regardless when we come back well what are you going to make with it.
PS0X9|See that's what I've bought patterns now.
PS0X8|Yeah no well I think that thinking about it seriously now.
PS0X9|What I want to find one is one without a well.
PS0X8|Without a well.
PS0X9|Yeah so it can hang over trousers.
PS0X8|Oh I see.
PS0X9|A long one.
PS0X8|What like a sweat top or some of them does.
PS0X9|Yeah yeah.
PS0X8|but I er.
PS0X9|We know that one that woman was wearing that white one.
PS0X8|Yeah yeah yeah.
PS0X9|now something like that that can go over a skirt.
PS0X8|Or anything and it's very versatile.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|No thinking about it seriously it would be better to go up there have a swifty through patterns you know you need a bit of time.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|you need a bit of time.
PS0X9|but then again it'll take me longer to find that one this morning.
PS0X8|Oh that was when I was waiting in the queue weren't it.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|Mm it really.
PS0X9|it caught my eye and I thought well.
PS0X8|Yeah it really is stupid having all these left overs alright as I said before I can make all that kid stuff but in the end I've got too much to take over.
PS0X9|Yeah and then again you don't always wan na erm start all along with them do you.
PS0X8|No.
PS0X9|And then you've got different colours that don't really go with that but.
PS0X8|Anyway I mean I've got a fair pile now to take in August ain't I.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|No I well the the colours that I like you know the cerise and the.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|the green I can I he's says to buy four of them without thinking about it cos they're so nice and that's really the thing that we don't do when we go to Basingstoke we start going around saying well which one shall I have but they said that you haven't looked at it like I've looked at those and you looked at yours because that oatmeal colour will be very very handy for erm sticking with anything and everything.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|Well I mean I've looked round here for a pair of blinking shoes the only trouble here er had over here is that I've got to go somewhere where they're wide enough and that's.
PS0X8|Littlewoods in n it The only ones here that did a wider fitting that one er at the time I bought some well those with the gold on the back was Stead and Simpson and they did a wider fitting but I don't know anybody else but they may now.
PS0X9|Probably do now.
PS0X8|they may now but erm I mean these I've got on are Williams they're an E fit that I I particularly sent away for.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|Well I don't want to do that any more cos you've got to wait three damn weeks nearly for the blasted things to come and then if they're no good you've got to send them back.
PS0X9|Yeah but there again you see they're you're not going into a shop saying oh they look nice.
PS0X8|No anyway those plimsolls they're they're alright.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|now I said the others they've got to be lace-ups though look it's got ta be lace-ups.
PS0X9|It must be easier to find wider.
PS0X8|Yeah because I mean if there if you've got a high instep it still don't matter because you only widen your laces don't you.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|Well perhaps I'll have a look in town next Friday then I could definitely do with a pair.
PS0X9|Well we could even oh dear we could even go.
PS0X8|oh dear.
PS0X8|yeah.
PS0X9|don't we.
PS0X8|yeah yeah we do cos it's there in n it Quite right.
PS0X9|If we're gon na spend money you might as well go to Littlewoods or.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|somewhere where it's decent.
PS0X8|Mm same the same situation as those clothes.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|weren't it Oh I didn't like them I was I could see them riding up the leg just like that pair I had on that day and in the end they look so grey and they look like.
PS0X9|I had a doggy bag the other day.
PS0X8|Eh.
PS0X9|doggy bag when their.
PS0X8|yeah.
PS0X9|in the end they do.
PS0X8|Yeah they do but they those others I was quite you didn't try them on so I.
PS0X9|No I forgot I was downstairs weren't I so.
PS0X8|buy one tomorrow but the material is better and the shape is better.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|and the stirrups are nice.
PS0X9|They're smart aren't they.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|But they've got to be long enough in the leg for me.
PS0X8|Yeah they have but there was people the other night with that type trouser on and boots.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|Yeah when I went in the ladies loo there was one woman in there and they did look nice.
PS0X9|Cord ones are beautiful.
PS0X8|Yeah well there again like I said before I tend to rub the cord and then they all.
PS0X9|Everybody does.
PS0X8|Yeah I know.
PS0X9|They are very stylish.
PS0X8|Yeah I've got mine back on now.
PS0X9|Eh.
PS0X8|I've got mine back on but it won't be long when I get out the bus mind but.
PS0X9|Say.
PS0X8|I said I'll put my shoes back on but I don't know what my feet will be like when I get out the bus.
PS0X9|yeah it's strange in n it coming back.
PS0X8|It's just as.
PS0X9|Yeah but it's a clearer road as well.
PS0X8|Yeah that's that's fair yeah just a different proposition in n it.
PS0X9|Well yes they're all sort of bubbly to get out there.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|We've seen it now were tired.
PS0X8|Not tired now but I shall want a cup of tea.
PS0X9|Oh yeah.
PS0X8|I might have a sausage roll the sandwiches are alright but you can eat them twice as many can't you.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|You know when they're packed up like that.
PS0X9|I think cos they're packed up and they're all fresh and.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|put the lettuce in and put the tomato in.
PS0X8|That's right.
PS0X9|and then.
PS0X8|Oh they weren't bad at all.
PS0X9|No they were very nice.
PS0X8|Mm weren't bad at all oh I had had something.
PS0X9|but I I couldn't of ate before we came out.
PS0X8|No but I wish I'd brought the pork pies with me I could of taken that one of them.
PS0X9|Yes.
PS0X8|I might eat one when I get out.
PS0X8|yeah well whatever just something otherwise you get up in the morning and you're starving aren't you Still it was well worth coming up here tonight.
PS0X9|Oh yes oh yeah.
PS0X8|Hello the thinner is really really easy tomorrow.
PS0X9|Probably do a.
PS0X9|or something.
PS0X8|Yeah could do that's a good idea.
PS0X9|cos that'll fill won't it.
PS0X8|Yeah I know.
PS0X9|You won't have as much.
PS0X8|Oh no we've got that other cake of yours.
PS0X9|Oh yeah.
PS0X8|No better have your cake.
PS0X9|Have my cake.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|Well it can stay in there.
PS0X8|Well we'll have a look at it and we might have both.
PS0X9|No I don't think you'll have both.
PS0X8|Why not.
PS0X9|Eat it in the evening.
PS0X8|Eat one of them I we have one afternoon like we usually do we'll have a look at it and see how big it is and all that yours and we'll go from there I mean actually for us three that trifle will only do that they're never that that big.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X8|Oh I mean if you want to put a tin of fruit with it.
PS0X9|Yeah but that that makes it large large.
PS0X8|We'll have a look at the coffee thing.

PS0X8|Why.
PS0X9|If I swim on my back I don't do my front.
PS0X8|Yeah well it's not really the wisest thing to do on a Thursday night anyway.
PS0X9|I cheat when I swim on my back.
PS0X8|Yeah but not only that when you get a couple of dickheads like we had.
PS0X9|Oh I know.
PS0X8|you know you've got to watch them they're not watching you you've got to watch them.
PS0X9|That's what puts me off when we have those two.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and we went on that other side.
PS0X8|Well we'll have to watch it this week and if er.
PS0X9|That annoys me when I get.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|people like that.
PS0X8|Well it does me on a night like that because the majority of people are either having a damn good lazy swim.
PS0X9|But there's the lanes there are nights when it's just even lanes.
PS0X8|I know yeah.
PS0X9|so they just have.
PS0X8|no very annoying that I mean that bloke going backwards and forwards is bad enough but.
PS0X9|Oh he's a right pain.
PS0X8|but then obviously that's all he does or what he does I mean which is.
PS0X9|Yeah but he's not a bad swimmer.
PS0X8|Well he don't seem to be a bad swimmer at all he really don't.
PS0X9|he just don't like going down to the deep end.
PS0X8|Maybe but it is difficult when people do that because I mean the majority of us are going up and down and you get this one that's going across and.
PS0X8|but the majority of people on a Tuesday night are going for a leisurely swim aren't they.
PS0X9|Yeah they're going for a swim.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|but.
PS0X8|but not tearing about anyway if they're.
PS0X8|of course I mean it'll be a little different this week won't it.
