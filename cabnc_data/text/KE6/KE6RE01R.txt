PS0X8|I du n no whether those people went you know.
PS0X9|They must have done.
PS0X8|Must of done tonight Cos I say the car was down the road I've never known that Never.
PS0X9|Do you know what.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|I know it's a horrible thing to say.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|but it's a shame nobody else.
PS0X8|Mm.
PS0X9|got woken up last night Sort of somebody's put the the road If somebody wanted to get out quickly.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and couldn't.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and they went to the wrong door and said is this car anything.
PS0X8|Well tha that's right I mean erm I.
PS0X9|Because say Gail and Keith go got woken up at threeo'clock in the morning.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and said.
PS0X8|That's right.
PS0X9|is that your car outside.
PS0X8|Yeah Well Alan did it here one one time.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|And it wasn't us.
PS0X9|No but you know what I mean.
PS0X8|Yes I do know what you mean Well.
PS0X9|It'll be unfortunate for the couple that whoever got woken up.
PS0X8|Yeah But it might do something I know what you're meaning.
PS0X9|Cos you du n no what Alan might have done.
PS0X8|Ay.
PS0X9|You du n no what Alan might have done.
PS0X8|Well.
PS0X9|If that car was there and.
PS0X8|Yeah It I think he got out and I I do he I said to you and your father how he got out I just du n no Cos it's a very difficult road this.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|But I think he did probably just because when I got up er when I co you see when I come down the stairs I can see through that window look.
PS0X9|Mm.
PS0X8|and Alan's light was on in the hall call it the hall and the car was there well a little while later he went I think he got out but I don't think it would have been easy there's that time this morning And I've never known these people put the car down by George's So knowing Alan do you remember somebody used to park their car in front of Alan's gate when they went to London.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|And he left a note on the windscreen But I mean Alan has to go up to London It's not long after sixo'clock in the morning that he leaves But er I fully understand what you're saying Really.
PS0X9|Well I say some let's say Sandra wanted to get out.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and couldn't and can't.
PS0X8|Yeah Yeah.
PS0X9|Right.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|And she should be able to.
PS0X8|But another thing is you see where Sandra lives you saying that where she lives is apparently erm P C now I don't know him but she does he lives up the same road and when people park didn't she tell you this when we were coming down.
PS0X9|No I don't mean that Sandra I meant this one.
PS0X8|Oh Sandra over here.
PS0X9|Right.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|Let's just say she couldn't out.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and she went to Claire and George tonight.
PS0X8|Yeah.
PS0X9|and said is anybody staying with you.
PS0X8|Oh yeah that'd do it.
PS0X9|That would do it wouldn't it.
PS0X8|But what I was gon na say was concerning them blocking these pavements if the.
PS0X9|I know as we I was there when she.
PS0X8|You were there when she said about P C Well if we had some I know there's two policemen up round the corner here Cos they walk down here here.
PS0X9|Is there any one in.
PS0X8|Well P C I think is an older policeman.
PS0X9|Yeah that's what I meant.
PS0X8|Mm These are two I reckon they lodge up here somewhere Not this road but round where Colin and.
PS0X9|any policemen isn't she.
PS0X8|Ay You what.
PS0X9|The lodger policeman.
PS0X8|Who did.
PS0X9|Linda.
PS0X8|Yeah she did didn't she.
PS0X9|A nice one.
PS0X8|I forgot that Yeah Yeah But you see somebody like P C being an older person he does it properly I suppose is what.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|the answer is He goes and knocks people's door and says you're blocking the pavement Well if he'd have come down here that night or that day when there was three cars in in the drive and one right across the pavement and then that that big lorry on the pavement he'd have had them wouldn't he.
PS0X9|Yeah.
