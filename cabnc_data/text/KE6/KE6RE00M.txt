PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|And erm a bit of couple of letters typed I mean the re at the least you could go and have a look I suppose if.
PS0X9|Is it somewhere.
PS0X8|He never said He honestly never said It seemed to me it were the type of place you could sit and do your knitting.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|If she's sat watching them she's pregnant but if she'd have sat watching Neighbours and she weren't able to was she And he did say to me well he has spoken to me about it he did say answering the telephone He said that.
PS0X9|Mm.
PS0X8|As I say I've only met her the once And she come up in the car for him once But I mean the first step is always the hardest I mean if that don't only apply to you.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X8|But er if you want it an and it's then no harm in going and having a look Is there Like I say the choice is yours hundred percent You don't have to.
PS0X9|I want it but.
PS0X8|Well the butt of it then has got ta be go over.
PS0X9|Mm.
PS0X8|I mean if if she wanted you to go out there today just if then the sensible is to pick up a taxi.
PS0X9|Yeah Well then I know where it is.
PS0X8|Certainly I mean I went I'm i if it's the place where we said it is then I mean it I know we went through Thicket yes I do Cos I saw their horses and which I think are Moira's But I mean you know what I'm like in a car I just sit there and then then your father turned in and there was all these where we went to get the carpet you know And that is as much as I can sort of remember But I really don't take much notice anyway sat in a car.
PS0X9|No.
PS0X8|I don't Still as I say no th it's it's a fair comment to say it's to be expected But if you can overcome that you know by saying ah what the hell It's either this or nothing which which it is and if you want it I mean Lesley's not bothered about it cos he's giving her seven hundred quid a blooming month Well neither would you if yo somebody give you seven hundred quid a month Neither would I For God's sake I wouldn't get up at six put the washing out and then go up there.
PS0X8|Thinking.
PS0X9|But there again one week you might one month you might get a one month he might give her that and bugger all the next month.
PS0X8|Well she says it's guilt money and that is possible.
PS0X9|Mm.
PS0X8|But I think you're quite right in what you say Quite right No doubt about that You never know with what she said anyway Unpredictable But I mean knowing her the the the sa the money she's had she will erm certainly look after.
PS0X9|Mm.
PS0X8|You know I mean she's been living off what seventy three odd quid has she.
PS0X9|Yeah.
PS0X8|So I mean there isn't anyway in the world that she's gon na bank seven hundred quid a month No way at all She'll er make the most of that because she won't possibly money for erm.
