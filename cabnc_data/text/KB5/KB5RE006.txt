PS028|I thought we're gon na so we came out of Paul's place behind Belmont Parade up past the ponds there and that's and I'm knackered I'm going up river had no you start at the bottom of Belmont Parade up those ponds up to the traffic lights where you change buses that's all up hill and it's slow and you've just started and you're not warm and it's like running out of here running up that hill there now you could run up that hill if you got if you had sort of round a couple of times round nice no one so more ready to go you'd run up there you come out of here run down here not warm feel you get well I come out of there and and you get you go up past that set of traffic lights you go up and you're still struggling past The Bull that's still up hill you get to the just round that bend and it starts dropping down and it's a gradual drop down below the roundabout and the next roundabout's pretty level there not too bad a roundabout right the way across to Scades Hill went down Scades Hill right the way down to Alton bottom of Alton high street came out by the toilets at White Hart to High Street up to house.
PS028|Mhm.
PS0YA|That's a bit of a drag.
PS028|Yeah.
PS0YA|That's a bit of a long drag that one not that Paul take open up a bit there and go a bit faster level but that was a bit Well's done a left up to Chell's Field and that bloody that killed him I bet you know the bit I mean and up over the fields where you go through the fields and fields that was the killer cos and coming back Bell's straight round to got to the bottom Hill wasn't too bad.
PS0YA|It's a short sharp you can see it there you get to the top of it get up to your roundabout we hang a right and the next it's a bit of a drag all the way up you save coming coming the other way it's down hill from just past The Bull until you get to the almost to that junction you turn off the top and you're going up hill just slowly but cor you get up to that our junction she drops down we went straight down through the High Street and we hung a right in the one way system turn left didn't get quite get to Green Lane turn left and up we come round the Green Lane up and in the back way.
PS0YA|Mm I say it took us three quarters of an hour to get there three quarters of an hour to get there just over the half an hour getting back Mind you got short that was a killer up round by place I reckon we got down from The Bells Chell's Field to the bottom of six seven minutes.
PS0YA|Might be a bit more than that but erm could of been nine She said wouldn't get up hill How these blokes go I don't know aren't they.
PS028|Mm.
PS0YA|Mind you it's the bloke in the front keeps don't he Keep tucked in behind the side always said to you the bloke in the front mate he does all the donkey work picking up drags you round don't it Whether he punches hole in the wind in the air or not I du n no like cards.
PS028|Yeah.
PS0YA|He does seem eager up behind some long as you get a right distance too far and you get oh they're fighting it again whereas you can get right up We were thinking of the car a slower car could overtake a by getting up behind you and when you coming out as soon as he comes out.
PS028|Yeah.
PS0YA|he's got to go back again.
PS028|That's what I thought.
PS0YA|But they don't do they You get or you get two cars of equal speed along straight.
PS028|Well it's a memento in n it.
PS0YA|one get yeah one gets up behind it and can in the back I suppose but they go after they and then you think as soon as you pull out you're gon na get all that yeah he's gon na get all that but they don't do they They don't Got ta be a reason for that I suppose Cos they're going flat out when they're like that it's not like you gon na say like when you go on a like overtake mode when you're like that they are flat out down the straight all you go to get a out.
PS028|Mm.
PS0YA|It's not like.
PS028|He goes.
PS0YA|Yes it's not like he's going he's he's going faster than this geezer he's not he's getting a drag from him then all of a sudden he comes out and he goes faster you think explain a little bit more on the old.
PS028|I really don't know.
PS0YA|same lines but he know he you assume that as soon as you got outside him that bloody draft would come round and push him back and the other bloke would carry on.
