PS0H7|Yeah.
PS126|All the time it's always like that and I hate that because I'm that's why I'm so slow too You know you have people who write it once you know once through I can't do that.
PS0H7|Yeah Yeah.
PS126|Impossible I've never been able to do that.
PS0H7|Yeah.
PS126|So I write like ten lines or something.
PS0H7|yeah.
PS126|Then poof I have to wait and see how I'm going to to do further.
PS0H7|What you know Yeah.
PS126|Because I have to structure while I'm writing I you know so I'm structuring while and I can't write as well.
PS0H7|You only structure I think that's a good idea er to structure before you plan make a plan before you start.
PS126|Yeah.
PS0H7|But I somehow I don't do it and I know I'm sure it is.
PS126|Yeah.
PS0H7|It is better No I.
PS126|Well I planned a little bit but even if I plan I still can't write it.
PS0H7|Yeah yeah yeah and you know what until I get started takes long for me and then I usually can get going you know but until I keep going or sometimes somebody and I say that's it And then after one page or half My God I don't know anything anymore.
PS126|Yes that's it.
PS0H7|you know what I mean.
PS126|That's it.
PS0H7|And then I have to start something else.

PS0H7|Wondering which.
PS126|You know Which is the most stupid thing.
PS0H7|Well no It's just.
PS126|And then I started one and I said no no no I won't be able to do this And I started another one and I said no I won't be able to this and got back to the other one and did the other one.
PS0H7|And I remember once we had that was we had accountancy and we have a year to pick that one We had to have solved so much problems and I just this way and I just wouldn't have it you know it's just impossible it's impossible and I hummed and hawed which way and hummed and hawed which way In the end it must have been the right one because I was the best of all and I you know until five minutes before everything finished I just couldn't make up my mind.
PS126|Hmm hmm.
