PS0H7|They don't make it anymore.
PS126|No.
PS0H7|I almost thought that too.
PS126|And then I have the jelly fish which is the totally transparent one.
PS0H7|Mmm mm.
PS126|The problem it's very expensive when it doesn't say Swatch and it's all white nothing so it's just a Swatch and so on it's probably not as much.
PS0H7|Have you seen it.
PS126|Yeah.
PS0H7|I haven't seen any of them.
PS126|I have seen those two This one I have never seen before.

PS0H7|eighty nine.
PS126|Yes eighty nine.
PS0H7|Hah.
PS126|Two years.

PS126|It must have cost a lot at the start but they.
PS0H7|But they are all the same huh.
PS126|No but those you couldn't buy like that This was a is an artist who made a special limited edition of them.

PS0H7|No.
PS126|There's in Switzerland and.
PS0H7|I see.
PS126|But they must have cost a lot.
PS0H7|Yes.
PS126|I think so.
PS0H7|As what.
PS126|Well.
PS126|They are exactly the same size as the others.
PS126|I know but you know we have a serie limit edition is full up During Swatch watches.
PS0H7|Did he.
PS126|Yes.
PS0H7|No I didn't know.
PS126|Hmm hmm in Belgium they were.
PS0H7|What did they look like.
PS126|They were all kind of silk covers with the painting in the middle.
PS0H7|Huh huh.
PS126|and the they cost at that time the Swatch costed about one thousand three hundred thousand francs and they costed about two thousand eight hundred I think.
PS0H7|Ah huh did they Must be they were all the same.
PS126|No.
PS0H7|I have seen just bigger ones black but very.
PS126|Yes those are called.
PS0H7|Which are very expensive but not forty one.
PS126|No.
PS0H7|And they have been very much but I though that Swatch cost that much no there are.
PS126|But some types before in the beginning all Swatches were the same price.
PS0H7|Ah huh It's that one which just with the tiger in gold no more.
PS126|No.
PS0H7|And I saw it and I thought ah I saw it in Zurich I'll get that I like it so it's er I didn't.
PS126|That I know how but I bought it.
PS0H7|You got.
PS126|At Easter time yes I bought it at Easter time.
PS0H7|Ah you've got it.
PS126|And then I amd they said I think that one is worth something.
PS0H7|And you have the men.
PS126|Hmm hmm.
PS0H7|And the men the woman as.
PS126|Mm mm yes.
PS0H7|Have you seen yeah.
PS126|Yes.
PS0H7|Yes Rather nice.
PS126|Yeah.
PS0H7|But.
PS126|and the one's too late I like that one too and I wanted to buy it as.
PS0H7|I've never seen do you think every country gets different ones.
PS126|Yes no well some countries don't get.
PS0H7|all.
PS126|all.
PS0H7|Mm.
PS126|Yeah For example well I don' know which Swatch really but on Omega up for example there are Omega watches in Belgium which you can't buy in Switzerland.
PS0H7|Can't they.
PS126|which are only made for export For example my dad's brother Omega which you couldn't find in Switzerland.
PS0H7|No.
PS126|Which was only made for export.
PS0H7|Do you think a lot of people buy watches.
PS126|Yes.
PS0H7|Yes a lot of makes then there can't be very much left.
PS126|Well the market is quite large.
PS0H7|Do you think Well I managed a collect a small very decorative I see forty thousand in how many years Two years Two years.
PS126|Yes.
PS0H7|I can not cost forty thousand.
PS126|I mean the one who bought that you know.
PS0H7|He must laugh now Why should we.
PS126|And I would be very happy you know.
PS0H7|and things like that.
PS0H7|Do you really think it's that much money.
PS126|No.
PS0H7|You would get it.
PS126|I would never give that.
PS0H7|But do you think someone will pay that.
PS126|I don't I don't know I have no idea.
PS0H7|'tis nice.
PS126|'tis maybe over estimated too.
PS0H7|I see yeah.
PS126|Ya so that if the goes up to thirty thousand the reserve might be large enough to give it to sell it for that price For example sometimes they overestimate certain works of art and you wonder you know during the sale you see it's estimated forty to fifty thousand so you think they'll never give it to you for less Sometimes a gets up to thirty and then they give it to the person.
PS0H7|Yeah it depends.
PS126|Then one wonders why It's just because or they over estimated it or it's the price you know.
PS0H7|They wanted to get.
PS126|They wanted to get.
PS0H7|Yeah yeah.
PS126|It's.
PS0H7|Yes well my dear look next time I have all again.
