PS0H7|twenty-ninth of June has never rained.
PS125|No did you read the article in The Times about er.
PS0H7|About what.
PS125|watering gardens.
PS0H7|No where is it.
PS125|Oh I think I've thrown it away.
PS0H7|Oh come on.
PS125|It was in yesterday's paper it's already in the kitchen.
PS0H7|Can you tell me everything or or should I read it.
PS125|It just says don't water if the plants look healthy don't water them we overdo the watering and it their roots then start growing upwards towards the soil.
PS0H7|What really.
PS125|Upwards towards the surface instead of down.
PS0H7|Why.
PS125|Overwatering don't know Kathy I'm not a gardener.
PS0H7|Oh overwatering what.
PS125|Overwatering is is damaging to the plants.
PS0H7|Ah then mine can't complain they usually have no water no.
PS125|Only water if they look as though they need it.
PS0H7|Really.
PS125|Mm and don't cut the grass too short.
PS0H7|And.
PS125|And that's what they say raise them.
PS0H7|I just think it's wrong because every day a tiny bit the ground loo looks much much better than if I don't give them for weeks an they do well.
PS125|Oh if you don't think they look well then they obviously need it if they look better after they've been watered that's what the paper says.
PS0H7|Well then they do need water.
PS125|That's the answer.
PS0H7|They.
PS125|if they look as though they need it they need it but if they don't look as though they need watering don't water them.
PS0H7|Well look look at the birds I aren't they sweet all the same I shall buy a nesting box next er next year.
PS125|Mm.
PS0H7|I'd like to see the blue tits come out you know there was a programme on television and you saw inside a box of a blue tit a nesting box right inside.
PS125|Ah yes.
PS0H7|How could they do that How can they go so.
PS125|Obviously put in a little camera in the.
PS0H7|Inside in the box.
PS125|in the or just in the.
PS0H7|In the corner.
PS125|in this little hole in the side of the box with a wide angle lens.
PS0H7|Oh I see ah I thought they had sort of you know like fairy tales you can see through the wall that's what they do put a camera in in anyway it was rather funny and those birds come out and grow up quite quite wonderful.
PS125|They can now put a television camera into your stomach.
PS0H7|Really.
PS125|And into your veins I think.
PS0H7|And in everybody's house what Oh yes and then ah here's a blue tit look there you see and then where does it connect up it doesn't happen.
PS125|I'm not sure perhaps it has a thin catheter or wire I don't know wire I'm not sure.
PS0H7|Just smells I like wild birds because that's the animal I like best because they are in the wild you don't have to cage them but you have the pleasure of them being free what.
PS0H7|Free isn't it You might get a bit of a mixture a few other birds not always sparrows.
