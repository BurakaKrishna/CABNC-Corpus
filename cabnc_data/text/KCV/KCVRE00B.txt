PS126|Nine thirty.
PS0H7|Not all day Three hours.
PS126|Three hours.
PS0H7|That's it.
PS126|From nine thirty until half past twelve The little analysis and communication board.
PS0H7|Oh my grief.
PS0H7|How many maybe that simple very simple eh.
PS0H7|And what is it really What is meant by that.
PS126|It is about comparing political sociological economic novels.
PS0H7|Well what do you mean.
PS126|Great communications great How can you compare how can you apply pluralism imperialism.
PS0H7|Oh my god can't you really find Which is.
PS126|or a corporate system how can they apply to communications.
PS0H7|I still don't know any.
PS126|Okay so.
PS0H7|Give me an example.
PS126|Erm alright.
PS126|For example when you talk of imperialism when you look at when we we've study it from a erm quite a few so it means that that capitalism supply.
PS126|and but the problem is that although it creates supply it laboured people who worked yeah.
PS0H7|Yeah.
PS126|can not buy it because it's too expensive for them So capitalism has to export it over its boundary and that's one of the company what you could call it period for example erm.
PS0H7|I see.
PS126|Let's.
PS0H7|Maybe become export become does it.
PS126|Alright let's see the French mm mm mm yes.
PS0H7|Well.
PS126|So for example I don't know erm let's take an example the French erm multinational tele telecommunications.
PS0H7|Yeah.
PS126|National.
PS0H7|Do you know you will find here that they say.
PS0H7|Yeah so you better if you have.
PS126|I haven't.
PS0H7|You don't okay.
PS126|Multinationals they have erm doing much better abroad than it is doing in France.
PS0H7|Okay well.
PS126|Because the French can not always buy what.
PS0H7|Alright alright.
PS126|so that's why it's only period.
PS126|Well you can call it export too but export is.
PS126|That means imperialism means in a way they're the French market it's well known and makes itself sell at much a than in its in its own country so you can say that for example Thompson has a monopoly tower most European and have a monopoly tower.
PS0H7|Yes.
PS126|in not only Holland but in Germany.
PS0H7|Yes quite.
PS126|Belgium.
PS0H7|Yes yes.
PS126|And so when you so it means that the Dutch are leaders so it's it's kind of that's how putting up the communications empire In Holland that the empire is broader than Belgium is.
PS0H7|Mm mm.
PS126|Broader than all over Europe.
PS0H7|Mm.
PS126|That's why it's called imperialism.
PS0H7|Ah yes.
PS126|So it becomes in fact a telecommunication empire.
PS0H7|Yeah it's really it it is the power not they're exporting.
PS126|Yeah.
PS0H7|Yeah.
PS126|The power.
PS0H7|It's more than.
PS126|Yes.
PS0H7|Logical side of of.
PS126|Yeah yeah.
PS0H7|Now alright that's imperialism yes What what's the other Eh multinational They do a bit of imperialism.
PS0H7|they are easy aren't they.
PS126|And then erm.
PS0H7|Brussels I my power at that that place and nowhere else and nobody agreed and well they say we go somewhere else and They're a big company in Brussels and they got they got their office where they like And now they're gone.
PS126|Aha.

PS0H7|You know I still keep the Italian you know it's more than French at that time and well I worked in I was I was really quite good at it but now I just lost it First of all I never hear it any more on the continent I can't seem to hear the radio you hear some you know put on the radio and you have a Brussels already he had nothing at all.
PS126|But don't you think that.
PS0H7|Oh no.
PS126|he would come back quick.
PS0H7|I don't know anybody aperitif and the and all that stuff you know the exception No And I I.
PS126|Aha aha I told myself I had to force myself not to.
PS0H7|I at once Stefan there was an I was anything just So a lawyer came and of course I had my own office confidential stuff so he wanted to give it to me and in the machine or something I had you know I never know you have quite a few words which aren't any French or.
PS0H7|one language one and the others have two or two.
PS0H7|Or else I Yeah.
PS0H7|And so I thought you You have Common.
PS126|Common.
PS126|Common No it's too.
PS0H7|As well.
PS126|Yes.
PS0H7|The French.
PS126|Yes.
PS0H7|I see is it.
PS126|Yes I know you're right now it's imperative with one and it's with two.
PS0H7|Yes That's what I mean poor chap he's he's getting furious and and there are hundreds of TwoS's you know and French you don't marks the difference Italian you do say that you have double quotes.
PS126|Writing I don't I don't think she'd she can write it there I don't know.
PS126|Italian.
PS0H7|Yeah and she ever uses it why doesn't she forget it.
PS126|Well I think she uses it quite often you know I mean.
PS0H7|Where where.
PS126|at the office or the Italians come she always uses it.
PS126|Well when there are I mean I think well I think it really con I mean when I'm with the Dutch I really thought the other day I can till David comes back again quite quickly.
PS0H7|Well I hear you but.
PS126|Mm.
PS0H7|I forget it erm where is it.
PS0H7|stop there for tonight but I had you know I just spoke French.
PS0H7|I just didn't open my mouth but I understood what they said and they didn't know You know and so so the second time the second day I could say one or two words and the third a little bit more but eh that's it.
PS126|Same when I'm when I'm in Italy I I can't speak Italian very well but when I'm there a week I pick up words very quickly and although I know my grammar isn't perfect I can form sentences in a way that people do understand me.
PS0H7|Yes Yes.
PS126|I that for me the hardest thing to do is example is study Spanish.
PS0H7|Yeah.
PS126|Because as I heard my mother speak Italian all the time and my cousins you really ca can in my you know in your.
PS0H7|Yes Your sub conscience yeah.
PS126|You'll pick it up.
PS0H7|Mm mm.
PS126|And I really understand Italian quite well and eh when I had Spanish I I suppose.
PS0H7|You picked it up.
PS126|All the time I had I had Spanish.
PS0H7|Did you.
PS126|And when I had to speak I spoke Italian.
PS0H7|Did you Well I didn't know Spanish but I got by with the Italian you know I had I had once don't you.
PS126|Yeah yeah.
PS0H7|And eh Julia and and eh Ruth and her husband eh went to Madrid and I stayed with Isobel.
PS126|Mm mm.
PS0H7|and we went to the beach and I came back and leap of the whole er side of the car You can imagine so I it's awful So.
PS126|Yeah.
PS0H7|I want other people's cars in.
PS126|That's very funny for example I went Dutch because when we were small my brother run away.
PS0H7|Yeah.
PS126|He always well we not always often very often spoke Dutch with each other.
PS0H7|Did you.
PS126|Yes because of we were in school together in Dutch and on the way home we were with Dutch friends so we then and we mostly spoke Dutch and now since I so it's nearly since now seven years have been since I have gone to States first year in eighty three came back in eighty four and since then we've never ever spoke Dutch.
PS0H7|Erm yes yeah yes Yes I see now ah yeah.
PS126|We always speak French to each other.
PS0H7|Yeah That a make if you spoke Dutch all the time.
PS126|Oh.
PS0H7|So.
PS126|Yes with my mother and my father.
PS0H7|All French yeah.
PS126|when we couldn't when when we were not allowed to in the States.
PS0H7|Really I think it.
PS126|But now it.
PS0H7|I remember a on the telephone you know I used to speak and talk and talk apparently she would switch to German so that means that I can't someone.
PS0H7|Shouldn't allow it I I always knew what it meant.
PS0H7|And that you make me think of it suddenly she'd switched.
PS0H7|For what happened she can do it because so okay let's hope it's going to be nice I really pleased with with that.
PS126|Really I really like it.
PS0H7|Sweet isn't it.
PS126|It's very nice with the plants on.
PS0H7|Yes yes.
