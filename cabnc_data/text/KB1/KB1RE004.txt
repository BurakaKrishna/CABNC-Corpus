PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|But at least they were happy you know what I mean because they were with other birds But I never missed I never missed him.
PS01B|I don't think you get attached to birds like you do animals.
PS01A|I don't think you get attached to birds like dogs.
PS01B|Not like dogs and cats.
PS01F|No.
PS01B|I mean Albert said if we do get that bungalow we are because the owner he said she'll disappear.
PS01A|She'll disappear.

PS01A|And yet.
PS01F|Aye.
PS01B|You know like when our Dawn's kittens disappeared It they weren't bothered I think Mick took them away meself.
PS01F|Yeah.

PS01F|she's took er fish and that and she's tried in ways like that.
PS01B|Yeah I mean I can't afford to take care.
PS01A|We tried to.
PS01B|We can afford to keep afford to dog.
PS01A|And Margaret's dad when they when my kids were little would never take our kids anywhere but they.
PS01B|It were me dad it were me dad that didn't take up.
PS01A|And always relied on one or the other I don't.
PS01B|Me dad wouldn't me dad didn't mind taking.
PS01A|I don't care which one But they would never take'em out for day.
PS01F|No I know.
PS01A|But they would fetch'em and pay for them and I even today you can not buy love.
PS01F|No.
PS01A|And it's proven my point our Dawn wouldn't even think about there Our our Corinne goes round when she got to.
KB1PSUN|Don't think about what.
PS01B|Our Corinne don't only go round when she got to She goes round.
PS01A|Goes round weeks ago.
PS01B|Well she won't go and stop Said she won't go and stop again.
PS01A|Who's gon na stop then.
PS01B|When we were all on about stopping.
PS01B|I don't mind going and doing her shopping and bits she says I'm not stopping.
PS01F|Yeah When you were on about that love what pa was saying about you know like every night that our kids when they had their pyjamas on and they're like to get hold I'm lying watching television I'm usually falling asleep but I put the kids you know And er last time I I get in touch me mum told me turned round and says to me I don't want any more mum I says why he says oh she won't let me have pillow and then I then I think if summat else brought to light I kill her.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|if she had come in.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01F|and that I know it's a filthy old thing but it it's comfort ain't it.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|And when they start let them have the pillow down they don't feel they can't get comfortable I know it's a little bit trivial like but it's just it's still.
PS01B|She has queer ways me mother Karen I I'm and I can't work me mother out so no chance for you working her out few years you've known her.
PS01F|No no I I I mean she's always been alright with me really I mean y you know she's not not at all she's not.
PS01B|Well me and me mum's me and me me mum's never been close It were always like me and our Colin were more or less with me dad and our Margaret and John were more or less for me mum Then when they got older me dad sort of took our John on because our John were mechanical minded and our Colin got pushed out a bit because our Colin weren't interested in cars.
PS01G|I found this.
PS01B|Oh yeah oh that's what that bird Yuk And our Colin was to be offt' fair and that so me dad sort of went on to our John and pushed our Colin out a little bit.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|But er me and our Colin's never been me mum's favourite It's always been our Margaret.
PS01F|Mind you did you see that photo that.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|You are I mean I could just work out I said your Margaret and John are a lot like you She is because she's got Margaret's lips and your nose but out of all of you I think your your Jo you can see your John in it can't you more than anybody.
KB1PSUN|I always think our John looks more like a Prescott because he al every time I see him I see me Uncle Bill more and more.
PS01F|Yeah John used to say years ago about how much that you're John looks like your Brian and I don't think he looks anything like it.
PS01B|No I don't.
PS01F|And she again now she says like somebody your John look like that bloke next door What a load of rubbish I thought well.
PS01B|No.
PS01B|He looks more and more.
PS01F|Aye.
PS01B|our Colin's getting more and more like me dad.
PS01F|Well Brian ain't it Brian Brian I think don't like er.
PS01A|they are they're all like that All of them.
PS01B|And I think our John looks like me Uncle Bill.
PS01F|Yeah I think he does.
PS01F|But then again he did look like that photo I think he does look like that photo but you were younger then.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|but he does look like Uncle Bill Mind you Colin's getting more like your dad every day.
PS01B|I know he is.
PS01F|black welding glasses on and he turned round and he made me jump Like oh Colin and then he go like this you know isn't it You know he'll come running glasses.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01F|I can't do it And right he made me heart jump because he looked just like your dad and then a few days later he's in garage again and Johnny come in and he said God he said he gave me a flaming heart attack out there I said why and he said he turned round with these glasses on then he said it was just like John's stood there I says don't tell me I said he did the same thing to me the other day and it were only within a couple of days of each other When he puts those glasses on honestly he's his double.
PS01F|I think it's the way he looks like if you know what I mean you know like pull his face and like look over glasses I mean he did it to me when did it to Johnny He probably thought like.
PS01B|He's like me dad er me dad he never had no patience and our Colin's just like him.
PS01B|Mind you I'm like our Colin as well in a lot of ways I haven't got a lot of patience But where where we're better off because Albert he's calm where you and our Colin are both fiery tempered.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|Where when I start Albert's.
PS01F|He I tell you want he doesn't do I shouldn't let you hear but when he when him and me are arguing when we were younger and me dad used to wind Colin up and wind me up and I'd get madder and madder and me dad used to love it But looking back you know and now that's what Colin does to me he winds me bloody up but I can't help it because he gets me that wild I should just I should I mean how can you change his temperament.
PS01F|I mean I should just turn round and tell him where to go but.
PS01A|I think Colin winds you up summat chronic.
PS01F|I know.
PS01A|And instead of just.
PS01F|Ignoring him.
PS01A|Ignoring him You don't he and he going through bloody.
PS01F|Yeah I know.

PS01F|You see what it is it's where they've been behind with their mortgage we will pay a slightly higher rate but it's only.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01F|a matter of about er I think I think the mortgage now is ten point nine and we'll be paying eleven point something.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|So it's only a matter of a.
PS01A|Yeah but one per cent's a hell of a lot you know It's a penny in the pound.
PS01F|Yeah but I mean it it will drop it will drop again But the thing is also what I thought of once we got ta us a mortgage and got established you could always remortgage and go into er like Bradford and Bingley and come out like that.
PS01A|Yeah once you get it back up to.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|Yeah well that's.
PS01F|Well I thought once we get.
