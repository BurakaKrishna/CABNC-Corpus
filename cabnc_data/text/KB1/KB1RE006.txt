PS01F|You just got to do it.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01B|I thought about it and thought about it and then then changed my mind But this time I decided it's what I want to do and bugger it If we don't sell it we we haven't lost anything.
PS01A|Oh well.
PS01B|sell it till we move.
PS01F|I honestly think myself.
PS01B|As long as we're not worse off than what we were before we moved.
PS01F|I honestly think meself that I might have a have a couple of hard months maybe three first three months might be a bit difficult for me.
PS01A|Oh it probably will be.
PS01F|Well I think once he gets established and once he starts getting work in I think meself that work will start won't say rolling in but I think the work'll start coming in after about three months and I can get established.
PS01A|Oh we can always lend you a couple of ten pences.

KB1PSUN|Benjy.
PS01F|Colin phoned him up and er it it he mentioned how he was starting up and he said he might be interested anyway Colin phoned him a couple of weeks ago to see if he was still interested in Anyway he says he'd pay him the same money as what he's on there because he'd have to really wouldn't just say say.
PS01A|You've you've got to but how the hell get it if he don't get paid up front.
PS01F|What do ya mean.
PS01A|Well wages.
PS01B|Got to.
PS01F|Well it have to come out of capital at first.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01F|put by ten or eleven thousand or whatever it is just come out of that.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|So we got money coming in.
PS01A|Mm.
PS01B|our Karen.
PS01F|But er I mean I says can't we manage without him can't you manage by yourself but Colin says he can't really because.
PS01A|He needs somebody.
PS01F|Yeah Well Colin's got ta be able to do a lot of office work he's gon na be out doing quotes you know what I mean so he's going have to have somebody there.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01F|Or I would apply for er family credit straight away get coming in I'm gon na say yeah we've got ten thousand pounds But we don't know how long it'll be before get any money coming in and if you go on to family credit you get it for six months so that'll be our wages So then what what comes out of business we'll pay him anyway.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01A|You might have too much in bank for family credit that ten thousand it's only eight in n it.
PS01B|It's got it's got ta know what increase when you running a business.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|Oh I don't know.
PS01F|If you apply for it straight away could you say you don't know how much monies coming in How much money your gon na coming in.
PS01B|His dad's in a new business anyway bec so you should get forty quid a week at least anyway.
PS01F|now.
PS01B|Is it.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|Bloody hell.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|It's like everything else.
PS01B|I mean that's seventy pound you wouldn't have had anyway ain't it.
PS01F|No.
PS01A|Oh.
PS01F|I ju I mean it now it's just getting me more depressed than nowt else I mean I just wish that they'd phone and say yeah we've got you a insured.
PS01F|And then I mean because we daren't say that to accountant know to have'ouse valued because what's point in I mean anybody said to us er get it sent off you'll find you're somebody will insure ya But what if they don't.
PS01B|You've lost all your ain't ya.
PS01F|Ya so that's the end of the world Even if you find out they won't.
PS01A|No Why don't you get a free put on market.
PS01B|No the on the company's that's coming up with all the money got to.
PS01A|Oh aye.
PS01B|do the valuation And they ought to form value of what so they know how much it's worth what the company that's gon na earn them the money want the money for the valuation.
PS01F|It's just another way of making a bit more money out it.
PS01B|That's it.
PS01B|Well it's same as when you buying and selling'ouses You when it comes out when the people that's mind me cigarette darling the people that's gon na buy your'ouse who mortgage company comes out and values it they've got that to pay as well haven't they.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|The same as I them that buys our'ouse they'll have to pay whatever it cost for'em to value our'ouse see if it's worth lending money we'll have the same thing with er bungalow down there.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|It's only money I mean how long are they'ere.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|Ten minutes.
PS01B|Mean that woman come out when when we had this done didn't she.
PS01A|Mm.
PS01B|To to see if it were satisfac she weren't here three minutes.
PS01A|No.
PS01F|What was that for for.
PS01B|You know when we had extension put up.
PS01F|Oh yeah yeah.
PS01B|Well.
PS01F|Did it value.
PS01B|They sent they sent'em out from er Abbey National and we had to pay well we did pay'im fifty pound people that put the building on paid.
PS01G|she keeps getting up.
PS01B|She's not.
PS01G|She is.
PS01B|She'll bite you and our Whisky can.
PS01F|She scratched him outside didn't she.
PS01B|And if she were here three and a half minutes that's all she were'ere and it and it'em fifty quid.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|Bloody ridiculous.
PS01B|It's all a bloody money making racket.
PS01F|Another thing is I'll tell why we don't want er they always having valuations they are they come and value it and then they give us money That means we're gon na be paying extra eleven thousand with money we ain't got.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|That's another reason we're daren't send it off.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01A|Yeah because if ya if ya get it before ya start your business You've still got it to pay as soon as you get it.
PS01F|Yeah Trust them because it's in their at the moment Well I still believe in and I don't pushed around and say no you can't have money no you can't get insured and so that means others.
PS01B|You haven't lost anything have ya.
PS01F|Well just er disappointment I suppose For what.
PS01B|Well yeah.
PS01F|Then again I mean I.
PS01A|There's always summat else you can go and do.
PS01F|You know that doing that fabricating and things like that you know like actual welding and that type of Er we wouldn't make as much money out of that as you probably would.
PS01B|No.
PS01A|No you'll be you'll be stuck to it all time and it's not good for'im.
PS01F|No.
PS01A|And it kills your eyes welding.
PS01B|Benjy.
PS01A|But as he said to me why don't you go welding I says the point is I've got bad eyes as it is.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|what's the point in making them worse.
PS01F|I know.
PS01A|So jump in me box and I ain't jumping in me box blind for the last ten years I'll manage the way I am.
PS01F|You see that works where I.
PS01B|Benjy.
PS01A|Aye.
PS01B|Benjy look at'im Benjy.
PS01F|Where are you when it's gon na be he said corner then we'll make an office and a little canteen in that anyway Then there's another long unit right at side of it just enough to get one trailer in I said I said if we do get going and we do start finding out that it's going alright he'll turn that into like er shop er blasting shop And like.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01F|A spray area then.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|Employ a sprayer So I mean we know what we want but it's them and not us I mean it is frightening to start a business up because we don't know how much work we'll be getting but I mean.
PS01B|Well it's same for anybody starting any business ain't it you don't know if it's gon na work as well.
PS01A|It might go well for the first three or four months and then all of a sudden we might have a lapse in a few months.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|you could be struggling to keep it above.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|and especially you know these bloody big firms they do not like paying bloody bills.
PS01F|No.
PS01A|I mean you could have as as much as two or three thousand pound owed to ya but your business will still go under.
PS01F|Yeah because of it.
PS01A|Because of it.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|They don't look on them things how much you've got owed out to ya I know.
PS01B|When you look you see everything's a bloody risk.
PS01A|Let's hope he gets off the floor.
PS01B|walking across roads a risk ain't it.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|It's ju just if you've got the nerve to do it.
PS01A|It's a risk with these buggers what's in power aye it's no matter what whose in power.
PS01G|I got.
PS01A|I think if labour gets in you'll not get it tough at all.
PS01A|I can tell you that now.
PS01B|Oohh.
PS01G|What.
PS01B|Oohh.
PS01F|You feel like er that's whose like ex soldiers throughout the company and he said to Colin er he said how many people are you thinking about employ our Colin seems to think there'd be enough work to keep'im going like he says he says well how many people are you thinking about employing he says only only me and me like it's oh oh he says there's plenty of work to keep two of going he said I thought you employed about six So if he thinks that Colin do have six working for him and he's got enough work for six then surely there's gon na be plenty of work for two of'em.
PS01A|Yeah but what he means by six is he gets the jobs done quicker.
PS01F|Yeah but then you still got six wages to pay out haven't ya.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01A|That's it He probably will have six later on if he gets it off but the thing is I mean he'll need somebody to drive wagons round yard and half the time y you know he'll be sat doing nothing scratching his nose Them's the people he's got to be wary of the people that want a job but don't wan na work for it There's a hell of a lot in Broadway and Stainford.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|round about here.
PS01F|Mind Lee's a Lee's a good worker he says that he wants you know best worker what he can.
PS01A|Yeah but I mean working for a mate is different to working for a firm.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|You know I mean.
PS01F|Well he's not a mate he won't he's working with him when he were at er over in Brad oh here's Richard now.
PS01A|Aye you'd better jump in bed with him.
PS01F|Oh dear no but he is Richard is the one with the comical magazine laughing bursts two incomes I think that's part of.
PS01A|Yes.
PS01F|Look slow down or you're driving me mad.

PS01A|I can't understand your cross.
PS01F|I know.
PS01A|Can not understand or something Their as different as chalk and bloody cheese.
PS01B|Plenty of different people cheap er the other people who have different likes to you but what what you might think's attrac attractive somebody else'll.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|won't be you know.
PS01F|To be quite honest without talking like a school on a fence They're not very happy they ain't been happy for a while but it's getting worse wh is what is them now is you know I say things to Colin and Co I mean Colin'll tell me like you know you know over there and er he's latest thing is they built this little office You know when you go into on the right er a and a house ain't there.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01F|The part it's is quite wide now we've done it big but altered.
PS01F|And then it twists and like a small office and when when I were there after Michael had shown it me and Colin he says oh he says er I'm come in here to get get out of way and you know he was like telling me I thought I don't want to be a fiddle because it's alright telling Colin the boys.
PS01F|telling yeah.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|ain't it yeah it's not like a woman telling you problems.
PS01B|Don't knock my dusters off.
PS01F|Anyway I just said well summat about about what I said I says yeah nice to get away from it all ain't it to be by yourself and that's all I said and I think he knew that I I didn't want to.
PS01F|but and he said to Colin.
PS01A|oh shit.
PS01F|said he said yeah he said it'll be ideal in here he said I can put he said put a full lock on door and he said I can come in here he said and so I thought ah.
PS01B|Yeah but there's not many people that you can.
PS01F|Sasha behave.
PS01B|I don't think I know anybody that hundred per cent'appy Well I think it's got a lot to do with the climate we're living in you know.
PS01F|Rushing about.
PS01B|There's that much there's that many people out of work there's and.
PS01B|you know there's that many pressures on people.
PS01F|I mean it's like like Colin and I I mean like we're happy but then no were not hundred per cent happy at all But like er like some people I can't if you get upset some people eat more some people eat less or you know some go into recluse some get and like Colin.
PS01F|he's when he's depressed he's goes like a raving sex mania he.
PS01B|I'm bloody glad Albert don't he'll drive me out of a bed.
PS01F|He takes all takes all his.
PS01B|Why didn't you stop.
PS01F|No I think every.
PS01F|I think everybody's got themselves summat some faults.
PS01B|Nobody's hundred per cent perfect.
PS01F|I mean I don't think Colin's unhappy where he wants to do then an offers an offer like either they go in and make share but if they work all day.
PS01A|No it's not er it's so much I mean he's at work all day and he works all bloody hours that God sent when they want when they got down.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|and what happens He's got to build an office where he can go and let sit in it can't abide.
PS01F|That's right.
PS01A|Summat wrong somewhere.
PS01B|Now look at our Margaret and Peter They've got no family so they've got no pressures like that they haven't got any money problems well they're not'appy They live two entirely separate lives.
PS01F|Yeah I know There's is just a marriage of er convenience.
PS01B|Convenience.
PS01F|In n it it.
PS01A|Yeah it's convenient.
PS01B|It's a way of life they've lived together that long like they don't want to.
PS01B|If when you and Pete had that trouble if our Margaret had er been working I honestly think she would have left Pete.
PS01F|I know.
PS01B|But the only thing that our Margaret could come up with was why should I why should I leave me home and sell up she said when all my life he's had money from the house He'll have the money from the house plus a wage every week She said and what will I have she said just the money from the house She said and where do I live You know he can move back home with his mum she said I suppose I can go back home to me mum well then I've got to look for a job you know.
PS01F|Mm.
PS01B|And I honestly think that was the only reason that she stopped for Pete.
PS01B|Yes Because she's she he he were gon na get a wage every week.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|You know and she worked all them years and then when she weren't working she have no money coming in every week.
PS01A|Yeah but she's got all the shares.
PS01B|She hasn't she got rid of them all.
PS01A|Aye not with Bl not with.
PS01B|Yeah but you could see you could see that I mean Pete were getting about hundred and twenty pound a week.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01B|We'll he had his money he won't have to touch he could live on that hundred and twenty pound a week.
PS01A|Oh aye.
PS01B|And he could start again Find another woman and buy another house and start again.
PS01F|Mm I mean like Jeremy and Kay I mean they're not happy They pretend they are but I mean like he's he's.
PS01B|They've got to do aren't they I mean after all bloody harm they caused.
PS01F|Yeah you know you know how flaming miserable and mardy he is.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|He's another one But you see when he living with Ange maybe he were younger then but I mean like when he were living with Ange he had all the women as you know plus he had Kay plus he had you know Ange he had everything there was Kay as well weren't he now he can't.
PS01B|No.
PS01F|But then again if even Kay over there with she said something about er oh we've been out but I told you I went to a last Monday.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|and she said something about oh we've been to that new pub she said mind she said we had to come home at half past nine she said he'd had enough she said he were ready for bed God she said he's turning into a right old man and you know what I mean she didn't she wouldn't.
PS01A|Exactly.
PS01F|She didn't realise what she was saying as such but I thought and I thought yeah I know.
PS01A|Yeah well he is what ten years.
PS01F|Thirteen you got from'er.
PS01A|Thirteen years difference.
PS01F|She's how old am I so she's Same age as our Kim.

PS01F|we've been married twelve years and we've moved three times so we haven't moved as much as them really.
PS01A|No No.
PS01B|I couldn't keep moving and.
PS01A|I couldn't move like that.
PS01B|I mean a couple of moves is fair enough yeah but bloody twelve.
PS01F|No.
PS01B|And it's not as if they made money every time they moved because they haven't because they lost money on that'ouse there.
PS01A|Yes.
PS01F|I won't it.
PS01B|Well Chris said they moved because er.
PS01F|Give up.
PS01B|er transport you know It would be difficult for'er to get back'ards and for'ards and she were on her own all the time.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01B|That's why they moved But they moved down they moved from'ere because he says er.
PS01A|Too noisy weren't it.
PS01B|Too too noisy and dogs were keeping them up all night.
PS01F|Oh.
PS01B|So I don't what the excuse is for moving from Road.
PS01A|Same thing because it's noisy down there.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01G|I could scare you Auntie June.
PS01B|Could ya.
PS01G|Yeah.
PS01B|Go on then.
PS01F|Why people think it's noisy for us on a double main road but it ain't really.
PS01B|Well you get used it in don't ya When our Norma come and stop here she she was.
PS01A|Used to sleep.
PS01B|I don't know how you sleep all night with all that traffic going up and down.
PS01F|No.
PS01B|But we never hear it.
PS01A|You don't hear it.
PS01F|No we didn't I remember one first night we stopped there buses were coming at crack of dawn.
PS01A|Yeah.
PS01F|it must have been about four or fiveo'clock in morning and now we never hear any traffic.
PS01B|No.
PS01A|No Perhaps you get used to.
PS01F|Yeah But we don't hear many people on a road like that.
PS01B|No I were thinking about that bungalow and well actually it's as far from our road nearly as far from our road to there as what is it from bungalow window to road.
PS01A|Where to yeah.
PS01G|it really is.
PS01B|Know thinking about people walking back as far ast' shopping my point There nowt much difference in fromt' garden.
PS01F|I think the only trouble over there is your to gon na have people parking in front of ya gate like when they go to the chip shop.
PS01A|They won't.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01A|They won't because because er I'm afraid if they do I shall be out straight away at'em.
PS01B|Well it's only a matter of parking at parking your own car as well.
PS01A|I'll clamp the bugger I'll buy a wheel clamp and wheel clamp it Park here at your risk.
PS01B|It'll be awkward getting cars in and out when you know with one more to be out and all these cars in road like but.
PS01A|That's the only difficulty.
PS01F|You'll probably end up say leaving one on road all night.
PS01B|Yeah.
PS01F|Don't hurt I mean.
PS01A|Oh not leaving one on bloody road.
PS01B|Well we could put'em at night time it's just through time if one backs in comes in behind other.
PS01F|Yeah.
PS01A|It's a one way street and all ain't it that makes it worse.
PS01B|Why does it make it worse.
PS01F|Well we don't have to have a problem do we.
PS01A|No but I mean.
PS01F|It's like barbed wire I mean that's Sasha come in'ere.
PS01B|What backs onto that bungalow Karen.
