PS1DR|Four add four and then.
PS1DS|Four add four equals eight Two times four equals eight right.
PS1DR|Yeah like that And then two.
PS1DS|And two times four is eight.
PS1DR|Erm I didn't write it like that then.
PS1DS|Right Share the total of fives.
PS1DR|Yeah I done yeah I done.
PS1DS|Er.
PS1DS|Five five five is fifteen.
PS1DR|Five add five add five.
PS1DS|Erm is fifteen.
PS1DR|and then erm.
PS1DS|Right Is fifteen.
PS1DR|And then.
PS1DS|And sixes.
PS1DR|Sixes six.
PS1DS|si.
PS1DR|add six add six.
PS1DS|add six.
PS1DR|add six.
PS1DS|is thirty six Right Six times six is thirty.
PS1DR|I've done that one.
PS1DS|sixes That's it Okay.
PS1DR|Erm this I'll leave that out.
PS1DS|Leave that out Add them up.
PS1DR|Mm.
PS1DS|That much closer can use those pictures.
PS1DP|Take a look.
PS1DS|Are they near the box.
PS1DS|Yeah.
PS1DR|Is that right Four.
PS1DS|Four is twenty So it's four so.
PS1DR|Four times five is.
PS1DS|Twenty Four times five equal twenty Er two times six equals twelve Er four times three equal twelve Er two additions left Alright.
PS1DR|Those two add So it's like one two one two and one there and but put like erm seven add seven add seven is.
PS1DS|Is twenty one Yeah Seven add seven add seven is twenty one.
PS1DR|One.
PS1DS|And three times seven.
PS1DR|Right.
PS1DS|is twenty one and do it that way five and fives Okay Two addition questions.
PS1DR|Hang on.
PS1DS|Two ad yeah but you've got right two multiple and two addition equations.
PS1DR|Not equations You told us this.
PS1DS|But i thi like these these are equations So two addition equations er three times se seven plus seven plus seven is twenty one Right Oh A so but you can also go.
PS1DR|Yeah Yeah add three.
PS1DS|Three plus three plus three plus three plus three plus three is twenty one Do it that way on Do you follow.
PS1DR|Yeah.
PS1DS|me.
PS1DR|Yes I do Right Two multiplication.
PS1DS|Yeah.
PS1DR|and two addition.
PS1DS|Two addition Right.
PS1DR|So you like you.
PS1DS|Yes that's right.
PS1DR|Then it's like erm.
PS1DS|One.
PS1DR|seven times three and three times seven.
PS1DS|And three times seven That's right.
PS1DR|And you do the same there.
PS1DS|Same on the adds.
PS1DR|And then this we do like.
PS1DS|Right she wants currency in two divisions in each right So it's one two three four fi.
PS1DR|That multiplication is a.
PS1DS|yeah well divisions okay so it's twenty one shared by say if that's one two three four five six int it.
PS1DR|Oh I know what I've got.
PS1DS|Six times three is eighteen or three times six is eighteen.
PS1DR|I know what I've done I've put the I thought it was er okay Six.
PS1DS|And division is shared by So you got to do eighteen shared by six is three and eighteen.
PS1DR|Have you got.
PS1DS|shared by three is six.
PS1DR|So like you go one two three four five six six times you swap.
PS1DS|Three.
PS1DR|six times three.
PS1DS|times three is eighteen.
PS1DR|is three times six.
PS1DS|Six Yeah and and you got.
PS1DR|Six times three and three times six.
PS1DS|A and division is eighteen shared by three is six and eighteen shared by six is three Yeah Got it.
PS1DR|I can not read.
PS1DS|Three sixes are eighteen You got it.
PS1DR|And you do the same there Hang on I haven't finished thirty three.
PS1DR|one yet That's what I don't get Why do multiplication equation for this similar line I don't a get how you do that Is it would you like us to put.
PS1DS|It's fours int it It's fours.
PS1DR|No two four six eight ten twelve.
PS1DS|Yeah It.
PS1DR|That's twos.
PS1DS|No but it's going to fours look It's going to fours.
PS1DR|Alright.
PS1DS|Going into fours.
PS1DR|What would I put.
PS1DS|Er one four is four two fours are eight and thre three fours is twelve As this is been shared by lines int it.
PS1DR|Yeah and it's on that one You do it like that do you.
PS1DS|Yeah cos it's being shared by.
PS1DR|Oh.
PS1DS|So it's I would say that is er nine times four equals thirty six And on that one is er sixty three shared by nine six time sixty three divided by nine.
PS1DR|four.
PS1DS|No Sixty three divided by nine is six Write six through it Ten six in n it.
PS1DR|No it's ten sixes.
PS1DS|No no wait a minute Nines What should nine times ten Emma.
PS1DR|One nine is nine two nines are eighteen three nines are.
PS1DS|Twenty seven Four nines are thirty six five nines are forty five six nines fifty four seven nine are sixty three.
PS1DR|Oh thank you.
PS1DS|Right Yeah seven nines are sixty three.
PS1DR|Hang on a minute Six nines are.
PS1DS|seven nines are sixty three.
PS1DR|Hang on a minute Seven.
PS1DS|Seven nines are sixty three.
PS1DR|Sixty three.
PS1DS|Yeah.
PS1DR|You work them out like that look.
PS1DS|Yeah Well seven nines well ee er it takes you so long.
PS1DR|Look one one nine is nine.
PS1DS|Yeah.
PS1DR|Two nines are eighteen.
PS1DS|So that one there is sixes into si thirty six.
PS1DR|I know But I still don't get what you have to write.
PS1DS|Well multiplication equation for this number line I would say is er I've already told you that.
PS1DR|No but I don't know what I have to I have to write.
PS1DS|Eight times four equals thirty six.
PS1DR|Don't get it.
PS1DS|Because it's one two three four five six seven eight no sorry nine times four is thirty six Nine times four equals thirty six Like this look.
PS1DR|Write it out on a piece of paper and you'll and I'll write them down.
PS1DS|No You do it yourself I've told you what to do You do it like that.
PS1DR|I don't get it though.
PS1DS|I'll tell you if it's right I'm just writing the answers out for you I told you what to do That's lazy Int it You crafty cow If I give you a bit of paper and the lot yeah well you know what to do and go to school and fill them in Couldn't it.
