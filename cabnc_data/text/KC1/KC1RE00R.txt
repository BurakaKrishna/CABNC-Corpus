PS09E|Yeah the front just hinges off at the top.
PS09G|It's not at the back of the here is it.
PS09E|It mi it may do why Have you spotted something.
PS09G|Du n no if it's the second one down that way or not but there's a crack across there Or is i is it a crack or a scratch This is the right one.
PS09E|Yeah that's the right one Oh I'll get my magnifier Thing is you're actually using your eyes are not too good.
PS09G|Well I go get the magnifier to read the bloody magazine sometimes It's ridiculous I'm going back to the opticians with the the new glasses I got are still flipping worse than these.
PS09E|No it's just a scratch I think Mm somebody's been working on this though haven't they The sound chip's in the wrong place.
PS09G|Crikey Well this is high enough.
PS09E|Yeah it's probably worth changing the control in n it to see what happens They've evidently looked you can see where they've scratched to get a screwdriver through there to try and get the sound the sound out.
PS09G|Couldn't you tell with the meter er th th th the control whether it's worth it or not.
PS09E|Yeah you should be able to.
PS09G|Yeah but I don't think the it'll do what you want.
PS09E|Yeah you'll have to Mm.
PS09G|Want a se want a screwdriver there.
PS09E|I got one there yeah.
PS09E|Yeah I got one yes.
PS09G|Gon na turn it as well.
PS09E|Yeah If you can oh let's put it on.
PS09G|around from one end to the other that is.
PS09E|Yeah Right.
PS09G|Right now one end to the other.
PS09E|Is it Oh Go that way.
PS09G|No.
PS09E|Well that's I'll get there eventually That's not reading through anything that one.
PS09G|That won't read through.
PS09E|Yeah I think so Now one end is joined so a bit Okay Nothing.
PS09G|No.
PS09E|So it was circuit then Just try the one above cos I think they're oh wait a minute I'm not looking at.
PS09G|You don't want to go there.
PS09E|I'm not silly sod Right.
PS09G|Right that moves Not much there.
PS09E|It should go right across at one end.
PS09G|No No that's.
PS09E|Oh it is open circuit then.
PS09G|Yeah it's trying to go that.
PS09E|Yeah.
PS09G|way.
PS09E|See if I reflected to this one I'll show you what the affect is.
PS09G|Tu turn.
PS09E|Tu.
PS09G|that.
PS09E|Yeah turn that one yep Even the Remember where you can get it back to that's the only thing.
PS09G|Oh Oh it's back where it was at one end.
PS09E|What are you doing this.
PS09G|Ah ha let me just twiddle it Hang on th check this up and twiddling time.
PS09E|Yeah see this is the wiper this should well assure itself back to that one.
PS09G|Goes when you touch it there.
PS09E|Yeah just touching the ends together.
PS09G|Oh.
PS09E|Mm I'll try the other one cos I've got that in bits If you can twiddle that one I'll er.
PS09G|Yep.
PS09E|second one down It reads totally different That's it Up one end down the other.
PS09G|More positive that one as well.
PS09E|Yeah That's.
PS09G|Yeah.
PS09E|what it should read like So it's definitely on the circuit.
PS09G|So it's down to the chip and we haven't had the chance of being.
PS09E|We might have to we might be able to get away without having to take the board out if I if I use the old de- solderer might be able to just hook it out and put the next one in Yeah but yo that's what they did change you looking for the fault.
PS09G|Yeah Mm mm mm mm mm mm Ah ah What was that in the I fo forgot now.
PS09E|Oh Feverack.
PS09G|Oh yeah.
