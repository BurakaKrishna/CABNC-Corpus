PS09L|Well.
PS09E|Yeah.
PS09G|It depends on his attitude if he'd been trying to pull a fast one on you and er.
PS09G|Yeah.
PS09G|this was like this when I bought it off you.
PS09K|Oh no no if he if he tried to pull a fast one we've already had one like that th that came in and bought a set unfortunately his father paid by cheque oh no well he paid by two cheques which they had a card on them I know very well they can't stop them very well and he went out and er and er the T V was only in the car and he went round a corner quick and he went brrrm like that you know.
PS09E|Yeah.
PS09K|and split the case and all on the T V and he come back in he said oh I picked this up he said and the case fell to bits And I was there.
PS09E|Yeah yeah.
PS09K|there and I said no my handsome you didn't pick that up and the case fell fell to bi he cos he was going on this is inferior not up to standard and so I said.
PS09K|I said now you can shut that up right away cos I said you know it's not I said er now if you want us to try to help you out on this you just tell us what you did Anyway his father was there and his father had paid and I said no you know you've done that So anyhow he his father said well that's right he said we'll be probably covered on the house insurance And they were anyhow so they had a brand new telly.
PS09E|Mm.
PS09K|And we had that one back and nailed them together and sold them again.
PS09K|But he tried it you know.
PS09G|Yeah.
PS09K|sneaky like that Mind I know there's some that when you can pick up if you're you know you could pick up something like that if you weren't careful and just pick it up from the inside.

PS09K|Actually we may have we've got one or two mashed up sets we may have flaps for them I du n no.
PS09G|It doesn't detract from them anyway does it I mean.
PS09K|Not really That's what you want really you want about a thousand of them now.
PS09G|Yes Yes if we could buy a thousand I think we'd have a thousand of them.
PS09K|Yeah yes.

KC1PSUN|Oh yeah yeah.
PS09K|Oh no I don't blame you If you've only got.
PS09G|Well it's unfair to everybody if somebody has the lot and then everybody can have a couple and keep a few of their customers happy You can always sell them within a couple of days of them coming in.

PS09E|It's not working.
PS09E|It's it's it's not a worker.
PS09K|No I know we're not er we ain't af we ain't afraid of a few bum workers cos we have got er good engineers like you know.
PS09E|This won't tune in this one it might be the tuner itself But these aerial sockets on these Toshibas are in a such a funny place that er.
PS09K|Yeah yeah See what you want is a little workshop out of sight don't you.
PS09E|Well I've got one in there but I'm just doing this as a to save me lifting it.
PS09K|Oh I see.
PS09G|Er no they're all about the same depth aren't they.
PS09E|Bring the through.
PS09G|That's the same yeah.
PS09K|If they're gon na go towards the window shove something.
PS09L|Yeah I know.
PS09K|in between them.
PS09L|yeah I is doing.
PS09K|Right okay Oh reckon they'd get rid of some of this stuff.
PS09E|No I don't understand it Rex I suppose they've got a they've got a certain contract to take new stuff all the time haven't they.
PS09K|Yeah I would've thought they could've like somebody with an older text they could've took the old one out and shoved one of these back into it.
PS09E|Yeah I mean that is that is current now that's what they use now isn't it That is their current model.
PS09K|Yeah.
PS09E|They use that chassis in Thorns and Bairds and things.
PS09K|Yeah So what's the tube alright on that is it.
PS09E|Yeah it comes on a comes on and then it shuts down so it's some sort of shut down fault.
PS09K|Yeah.
PS09E|We haven't looked er we haven't even got a manual for it.
PS09K|No No no no Well anybody that's anything like an engineer as long as it's clean and tidy and not been chucked around.
PS09E|That's right.
PS09K|they can fix it can't they.
PS09E|Yeah oh yeah it's all fixable Long as the tube's alright that's the main thing.
PS09K|Yeah that's the main thing on that That's a nice looking machine that one.
PS09E|Probably would actually wouldn't it yeah.
PS09G|Which would leave us room for the.
PS09E|What have you got one one more to g.
PS09E|two more.
PS09G|different Put er that on top of those put a portable.
PS09L|Have you got the little portable.
PS09L|like that.
PS09G|Two more.
PS09E|Yeah there's that one and one more Wonder if they would go cos th n n they're no different on their ends are they really.
PS09G|Not really no they're practically squares aren't they.
PS09L|No they a yeah Which is the smaller of the portables.
PS09G|They're all about the same there's hardly any difference in them Hardly any difference at all the blanket portables on the blanket.
PS09L|We're not taking the blanket all out erm from underneath all of them.
PS09E|Well we've got plenty of cardboard plenty of cardboard.
PS09G|Plenty of cardboard yeah.
PS09K|With the blanket though he would they would stop them from moving like you know.
PS09L|yeah.
PS09G|Yeah Erm haven't got anything like a blanket.
PS09L|And we've got them two to go.
PS09E|Yeah.
PS09L|Can't we put the bigger the bigger of them in under my feet.
PS09K|I.
PS09E|If you put them on their sides they're too They'd go on their sides wouldn't they Perhaps If we had a.
PS09K|blanket though we could have done that easy enough.
PS09G|Oh I see you're gon na turn them on their sides are you.
PS09K|catching on reasonably well for the time of the year.
PS09K|Yeah.
PS09G|Yes They've converted people to it so they they find that they.

PS09E|I think those two on the sides one on there er f put that on its side as well perhaps Oh no it's not any better is it on its side that one And Toshiba could go in there couldn't it and the other one on its side in there.
PS09G|What erm top to top to top.
PS09E|Top to top yeah And side to side.
PS09G|is easy we can pack.
PS09K|We're gon na need to put something in between that.
KC1PSUN|A bit of cardboard between that useful.
PS09E|Got ta fix that aerial back on.
PS09G|If I lift it could you slide that in.
PS09G|And I've put something in there so we don't get any there.
PS09K|Yeah We're away.
PS09G|but er I can't work out where.
PS09E|Well if you put that one across under that one and then I can get this one up through the middle it's just the depth in the middle there in n it.
PS09K|Yeah.
PS09G|Oh I see put this one.
PS09K|Over there.
PS09G|Alright And then something in between these to stop any rubbing.
