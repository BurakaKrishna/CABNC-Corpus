PS09G|If the worst comes to the worst Dave's found a place where we can get new tyres for about twenty five quid each for the M G.
PS09E|Oh yeah.
PS09G|He's still trying to find some he's phoned a bloke in Plymouth see if he can get them.
PS09E|That's a nice tyre we got for the erm caravan for ten quid It's er.
PS09G|would be nice cos they look ni we had on the other white M G and they're a nice.
PS09E|Yeah.
PS09G|The other one's all arrived over safely and the bloke's driven it and he's all happy with it.
PS09E|Oh good.
PS09G|and waiting for his next one to come.
PS09E|Oh marvellous.
PS09G|Er.
PS09E|Is he selling them over there.
PS09G|No he's keeping them for just fun cars for himself he's just got the money to burn over there.
PS09E|Marvellous.
PS09G|so he's only he's got a one of the new B M W seven three five that er no the big Merc a big new Merc through that's right not the the latest Merc so he says er er he's a bit disappointed with the brakes on the M G but Dave said they were a phenomenal brake for an M G he said.
PS09E|Yes.
PS09G|compare it against the latest Merc.
PS09E|That's right.
PS09G|He's all.
PS09E|I expect.
PS09G|he's all been paid all his money and.
PS09E|Mm but it's good in a way that he's got his money because he can sort of sort of finance ours.
PS09G|Well yeah he is he's got a little bit anyway.
PS09E|till we yeah yeah I should imagine he is.
PS09G|quite a few bits and pieces It's getting Kevin in to finish it off I phoned Kevin I've got Kevin's mum and dad's phone number off Dave and phoned at home but he's gone out for the day or something they said.
PS09G|But he's got to strip the bonnet so Dave said well I'll get my lad to strip the bonnet this afternoon and er you know few hundred quid for the day we'll be glad to be able to finish off doing them and He's got too many.
PS09E|Yeah cos you haven't been able to.
PS09G|to play with really er we c to clear ten we've still got two and a half grand left.
PS09E|Have we.
PS09G|and so there's twelve and a half grand we're owed.
PS09E|Yeah yeah.
PS09G|so if he charges you know fifteen hundred for his bit and then another grand to finish it off we're still clearing ten you know.
PS09E|Oh well that's good then.
PS09G|we might even clear a little bit more than ten but.
PS09E|Bit more than ten yeah.
PS09G|I mean if he charges two and a half I wouldn't be disappointed cos it's been in his garage he's pushed everything along and he's always so.
PS09E|Yeah oh and he's been pretty reasonable hasn't he.
PS09G|we're all going out for a drink with yourselves I think.
PS09E|Good That sounds like a good idea.
PS09E|Me I don't drink.
PS09G|No don't drink any more.

PS09G|the technology just from a.
PS09E|I mean that's so easy in n it.
PS09G|It's beautiful in n it Easy to work on.
PS09E|Yeah.
PS09G|All you've got ta do is find out what's wr gone wrong with it.
PS09E|Well I should think it's this little frame chip here I'm.
PS09G|Oh.
PS09E|I'm gon na check all round I mean I should imagine that's what it must be.
PS09G|Standard one is it Or something weird.
PS09E|Well it's bound to be something weird I suppose fifty oh looks like a five five one thread.
PS09G|A N.
PS09E|What do you make it I think that's.
PS09G|Well have a look.
PS09E|I'll get the t the torch that's what I want probably.
PS09G|Ah yep perfectly correct A N five five one five you won't have one of them in stock will you.
PS09E|No Have a check see if the go in that direction pretty sure they do la la la la la yeah that's it that's the frame output chip I think I might just give it a solder over because it's er a bit dry in that area.
PS09E|Oh yeah.
PS09G|That's I've done all of that plus them others you.
PS09E|Yes I'll just try these erm solder up this service switch and er everything else seems alright there's no anywhere mind you it's nine times out of ten it'll.
PS09G|Oh quite a nice design in n it eh The leaves are long enough to.
PS09E|Yeah I can leave the speaker off for a minute I can just about get in behind without blowing myself up I think No that's what it'll be then.
