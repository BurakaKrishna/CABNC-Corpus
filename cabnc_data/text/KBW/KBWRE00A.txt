PS087|Could you tell her we're going to watch Inspector Morse.
PS08A|for the third or fourth time Will she have watched Inspector Morse She won't of watched it cos it's bound to be on a Wednesday night Does she like Inspector Morse.
PS087|I don't think she watches it normally.
PS08A|No she probably doesn't like it A bit spicy.
PS087|I bet she would she loves anything like that Bit of a body Mind you it might be too complicated.
PS08A|It was I remember reading in the paper that it's been it's been filmed at a house which no one's ever been allowed to go in even the great sort of one of these country mansions it was not Bradley Hall.
PS087|Right.
PS08A|And even people who write about.
PS087|If it was not Bradley Hall it can't be Bradley Hall again they're always going in there.
PS08A|Well that's fine It was some country mansion in Oxfordshire you know.
PS087|Mm.
PS08A|It's as you come off the.
PS087|And how did.
PS08A|and.
PS087|they get permission then.
PS08A|They somehow managed to persuade the owners apparently it was and it was and nobody else had ever been allowed in this place not even erm historians who write about famous buildings even they had been refused access.
PS087|Where is it.
PS08A|Somewhere in Oxfordshire.
PS087|Oh They don't know where.
PS087|Oh So.
PS087|this was about last week's episode.
PS08A|I think it was about last week's epi but they seem to e imply that it was last week's episode that would.
PS087|Oh.
PS08A|do it.
PS087|We seem to have got one spare video if we don't get it watched before Wednesday.
PS08A|Alright Well that's the only chance.
PS087|Oh yeah cos we're going to Maryland tomorrow your dad.
PS08A|Mm.
PS087|Erm not it wasn't about your dad it was about my birthday cos.
PS08A|Cos yo.
PS087|he'd realized that it was my birthday and wha what did I want So I said send me a cheque and I'll go and shop.
PS08A|And.
PS087|And last week cos she's quite generous isn't she.
PS08A|She is a bit but it's.
PS087|No I didn't say anything.
PS08A|I think that's the thing.
PS087|So your dad sent a cheque Anyway I asked her if she'd heard from your dad and she has heard from your dad apparently on Friday he went to the consultant.
PS08A|Mm.
PS087|and next week he's got his first well she didn't know whether it was radiotherapy or chemotherapy And she said he has to go trotting to Exeter two or three times a week now.
PS08A|Mm.
PS087|I don't know how long it's going to go on for or what it is exactly but I thought it would be a good idea to ring your dad up and see.
PS08A|Mm.
PS087|But at least things have moved and at least they've gone round So I'm pleased really are you Interesting that they've done it so quickly isn't it After seeing him because he thought that once he'd seen the consultant it would then take some time to get the treatment started but they must have got themselves over that.
PS08A|Yeah Well I mean everyone.
PS087|Yeah.
PS08A|I think.
PS087|Got ta get moving.
PS087|And presumably whatever it was the gp had give him has had tha upset that thrombosis again I don't know whether to ring him tonight oh it's too late tonight now.
PS08A|It's much too late.
PS087|Perhaps we could ring tomorrow afternoon when the children are up Well they love talking to them on the phone don't they.
PS08A|I know they do.
PS087|We could can prime them up on what to say and types of things to talk about so they don't get moaned down or something Bogged down.
PS08A|So he's had to go in what did you say Three times a week.
PS087|I don't know she just said.
PS08A|Something like that.
PS087|a few times a week and I think it sounded like three cos she was wondering how he would cope with driving and everything.
PS08A|Mm a trial.
PS087|Well I hope not I mean no he won't be able to drive.
PS087|but presumably your mum can do that for they've got hundreds of people there he's always driving people everywhere.
PS08A|That's right.
PS087|so I don't see why they can't drive him I'm sure they will.
PS08A|Yes.
PS087|cos they're very good aren't they I mean look at that woman doing her er from the from the church.
PS08A|At times like this it would be nice if we lived nearer could help out.
PS087|It would nice if we lived there but we can't so.
PS08A|It's about.
PS087|And write as well.
PS08A|Yes.
PS087|Double dose.
PS08A|Yes And pulled out.
PS087|Well it's sort of pulled out but at least it's.
PS08A|We'll be paying for it as well.
PS087|And it's hard as well.
PS087|We've been paying anyway so it must of you know What does erm you see er Eileen's and she's having chemotherapy isn't she By me by medication is.
PS087|that right.
PS08A|Well she takes all these tablet things.
PS087|That's right she has a sort of massive dose every now and then And that makes her feel what She's not in pain is she More sort of dopey.
PS08A|I wouldn't care if they made me dazed.
PS087|Yeah.
PS087|Yeah I du n no.
PS08A|Not gon na.
PS087|Difficult to know.
PS087|Oh yes that was it I wonder how bad it is that feeling's like we don't really know how bad it is do we.
PS08A|No.
PS087|Perhaps he will be able to say you know But whether he'd tell us over the telephone you think ask I think he would wouldn't he.
PS08A|I think so.
