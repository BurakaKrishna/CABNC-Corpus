PS087|They all sort of surfaced.
PS08A|You were all asleep when I er.
PS087|I think I'd had I finished my breakfast when no I think you just came just as I was about to take my first mouthful of cereal It was about quarter to eight before everybody well after that.
PS089|No but it wasn't.
PS087|What time did you get up What time did you go.
PS08A|I left at twenty to eight.
PS087|Mm It was about ten to eight when Christopher got up But Tim was still asleep till about quarter past eight.
PS08A|Oh.
PS088|And I shouted for daddy.
PS08A|Did you.
PS087|Which is unheard of Yes you did shout for daddy.
PS08A|You shouted for daddy I was already at work.
PS087|There was no daddy He'd gone to work already So then we had a bit of a wonder whether or not Christopher should go to school And I decided he was should stay at home.
PS08A|It's probably just as well cos.
PS087|Mm.
PS08A|pool his strength for tomorrow.
PS087|He was a bit sort of wobbly on his legs at the beginning of the day but he's been.
PS089|Yeah.
PS087|fine since.
PS08A|And Tim's going to.
PS087|Nursery.
PS08A|Holly Cottage tomorrow Aren't you.
PS088|Ow Where Look I found a yellow.
PS087|We did go down to the library Cos I thought it would it was such a warm day I thought it would be quite nice for him to have a walk see if he was alright Anyway managed to walk to the library and walk down the shops But when we got back we had to lie down in front of the video for a bit.
PS088|Mum.
PS089|Mum can I for a minute please.
PS087|Mhm.
PS08A|So you just did your own private trip to the library.
PS087|Yeah I rang up and said I wasn't gon na go the children Anyway it turned out we met Ann and erm both Martin and Ian are been having a similar trauma.
PS08A|Have they.
PS087|Mm.
PS08A|Oh.
PS087|Ian's been sort of talking about all sorts of strange things in his sleep and.
PS08A|Really.
PS087|delirious and hot hot.
PS08A|Yes.
PS087|fever So.
PS08A|It's odd A bug they're passing around.
PS087|Mm Must be.
PS08A|Child to child.
PS087|And she said Martin was hot but nothing too traumatic A bit like these two really.
PS08A|Mm.
PS087|But Ian had been sick as well.
PS08A|So it's likely they picked it up from them.
PS087|I should think so Although Christopher didn't really see much of them did he Oh he did on Thursday didn't he.
PS08A|Mm.
PS087|I would have thought Tim would have had it worse from contact erm wise These things don't work like that do they.
PS08A|No And is the parentage alright.
PS087|Mm.
PS08A|Only strikes children.
PS087|Yeah Well it certainly did in both these cases Although I met Theresa on the way back from erm school and she said Alec was at the doctors cos not the way back from school way back from the library And she said Alec was at the doctors cos he was feeling under the weather.
PS08A|Yeah.
PS087|So I don't know what that's in aid of.
