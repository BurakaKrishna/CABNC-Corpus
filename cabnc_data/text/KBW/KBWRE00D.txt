PS087|Didn't didn't include what.
PS08A|He was listing I should read a story on mother feeding the five thousand.
PS087|Oh it doesn't what you.
PS08A|or something like that But these are.
PS087|what you mean the.
PS08A|the only ones that I've found well they were that was all.
PS087|I don't care what it was it was just kind of you know a story that they might know.
PS088|Can you do it cos they're not.
PS089|No there we go I'll take that.
PS087|just happened to be the children's that's all.
PS08A|Does that matter I mean I'll bring them back again.
PS087|I suppose as long as you bring them back it won't matter.
PS08A|Yeah.
PS087|As long as they don't want to borrow them.
PS08A|Yeah.
PS087|Cos I thought it wasn't very fair to lend out the children's stuff.
PS08A|No.
PS087|I suppose for hours cos I had loads from when I was teaching so wi that I've donated those cos our own children would never get to mark them.
PS087|Oh well ma we were considering ooh we got a green Jesus here.
PS088|A green face.
PS088|cos like that but.
PS089|Right now we don't need that for a.
PS087|Is little girl still in bed oh well we'll make her food up shall we.
PS088|Because that will be blue with that then.
PS089|Right I'm gon na make.
PS087|blue are they Actually I don't think they are really you know Do I look blue.
PS088|Yeah.
PS087|We have blue clothes sometimes.
PS088|Er.
PS087|don't you.
PS088|I've got blue ones.
PS087|You don't usually have a blue.
PS088|I did you a blue face.
PS089|But we blue fa.
PS087|Cos you don't usually have a blue face Still when you're drawing you can draw anything really Might have a red dress oh it's pyjamas I suppose if they're in bed or a nightie Try and give her a red nightie.
PS088|That's the sky it's all.
PS087|No that's supposed to be what he's thinking look he's got little blobs coming from his head.
PS088|Why.
PS087|Cos he's thinking about Jesus I think he's going to the dentist or something and he's a bit frightened so he thinks he thinks of that.
