PS0XU|You were damn rude darling.
PS0XV|Yeah.
PS0XU|being in an attitude you've forgot to.
PS087|no it's alright.

PS0XV|Well I think I've over watered it.
PS08A|Best to let it.
PS0XV|I know I'm I'm.
PS0XU|I don't water mine very often I wait till the one of the leaves start to go a bit yellow and then.
PS0XV|Oh.
PS0XU|I don't like them personally.
PS087|Why not.
PS0XV|somebody else wanted one.
PS0XU|I hated it.
PS087|Ah there you are.

PS087|together.
PS0XV|it's about twelve feet no yeah about twelve feet tall.
PS08A|I've put it on the stairs you see so it's got like double height to go to it's nearly filled that the thing is the.
PS08A|at the bottom then about six foot gap and then.
PS08A|at the top.
PS087|Yeah.
PS08A|the.
PS08A|the branch goes to the top.
PS087|You won't do it like that you'll have to sort of.
PS087|I suppose a handle of.
PS087|Well now that'll do us.
PS0XU|instead of having I mean you don't think at the time but what she should of said was can I go away come back for another interview another day which means she she's.
PS0XU|for the hour because all she could think of was this.
PS0XU|of course if she told me as soon as she'd done it.
PS087|Yeah.
PS0XU|I cou I would of said well right tell them.
PS087|yeah yeah.
PS0XV|Mm.
PS0XU|ask them for another go of course she left it till she had the results and then told me so I'm writing now to the.
PS087|yeah.
PS08A|Mm.
PS0XU|so cos she's stuck in working.
PS0XV|Even if she's not.
PS0XU|selling curtains for them and erm obviously she was.
PS087|Is there anybody we know that's any good at tuitioning.
PS0XV|Oh I come back from.
PS0XV|of private lessons but I just really can't get a grip of it.
PS087|No I meant just sort of somebody we know.
PS0XU|What would we have to do.
PS08A|The trouble is that.
PS087|like if you were dyslexic I could help you.
PS08A|I could help with maths.
PS0XU|You've got to know the syllabus though and you've got to know what I don't know what.
PS087|Yeah you've got to know what you're doing.
PS0XU|It's not a case of helping because in the letters I know what I know what I'm doing I'm just I'm just gone to.
PS087|yeah.
PS0XU|I've got everything right actually what I did and I couldn't give you I haven't got a clue trigonometry well I couldn't tell you how to do it I should.
PS087|That's why you need somebody you can ring up and say look we did this yesterday what am I doing wrong today.
PS0XV|Yeah.
PS0XU|It goes out my head from one week to the next I can't keep it I know what I'm doing.
PS087|Keep it up.
PS0XU|at the time.
PS087|some sort of.
PS087|but again if if somebody who knows about the G C S E actual course.
PS0XV|you know the G C S E did you know about.
PS0XV|yeah I did that at school.
PS087|Someone must teach it somewhere.
PS0XU|Erm oh erm.
PS087|Who.
PS0XU|Mike.
PS08A|I was gon na say Mike has had a degree in that.
PS0XU|He.
PS0XU|but he might know.
PS08A|What you'd have to do you know you tell him what you need to know he'll be able to tell you how to do it.
PS0XV|Oh I don't even wan na do it I just need.
PS08A|It's good book though isn't it.
PS0XV|books here yeah I just read them I don't know if I can do it I.
PS08A|but it he needs to find out what he needs to teach you through the book so you know.
PS0XU|What you need to do is to find.
PS08A|books are they.
PS0XU|a memory thing that will you know click your memory you know how some people have an a.
PS0XU|yeah.
PS087|well.
PS0XV|I know what you mean.
PS08A|I can just remember though you know over the.
PS087|No I remember.
PS087|I just need something that reminds you of what you've done rather than er.
PS0XV|Like my.
PS0XV|I just can't remember that twenty.
PS087|Well you'll pass.
PS0XV|No you don't pass or fail you get given marks out.
PS087|Yeah but I mean you only.
PS0XV|that was.
PS0XV|and I'd written down.
PS0XV|just sit down and listen then read the question wrong.
PS0XV|write down the answer.
PS0XV|anything from.
PS08A|What I could never do was.
PS08A|but I could never do them.
PS0XV|being those things like well I can't do those tables.
PS087|all the.
PS087|and what not.
PS0XV|at all I've never since a child remember.
PS08A|Well you should of been learning those.
PS0XV|I've tried I can't for the life of me remember them.
PS08A|I can't remember.
PS0XV|I've tried.
PS087|Can you get up to five fives.
PS0XV|twenty five.
PS087|Yeah but can you get up to that like get all your other tables.
PS0XV|No I can't remember.
PS087|Right you know the twos threes and fours and fives tables.
PS0XV|Twos no no.
PS087|Oh dear.
PS0XV|I can't do them I've learnt them.
PS087|sixes onwards I'll show you how dyslexic to do it with their hands.
PS0XU|I've got my sheet of paper.
PS087|You don't need.
PS0XU|One two.
PS0XV|Ooh somehow.
PS08A|We learnt them by chart.
PS0XU|Yeah I did that at school we had to stay in most break times as a child cos I couldn't remember and I I know that my mum bought me a books so I used to sit for days and days then my mum going over and then my nan going over and I couldn't remember if I wanted to.
PS087|The number you have put them together in different places and as usual I got the numbers that fell of the.
PS087|couldn't sort out so those things bit confusing so.
PS087|complicated when you start it out but if you can't remember for the life of you then it's quite.
PS0XV|Yeah I have to do it you know four fours five fives erm providing I remember those middles then I can carry on anything over.
PS087|I know.
PS0XV|you know say seven sevens I know are forty nine.
PS0XU|Mm.
PS0XV|so that eight sevens are fifty six and I carry on from there but you can't do that.
PS0XU|you've got to have something like.
PS0XV|well I I.
PS0XU|I can't do it yeah I can't do it.
PS087|And are there things like that then tables Or is it more complicated Yeah I was gon na say.
PS0XV|No they're much more complicated if you get an equation what's X.
PS087|Right.
PS0XV|and you've got ta find you've got ta know what happens.
PS08A|I'll take Wednesday.
PS087|Yeah.
PS0XV|and like they give you a secret number of what comes next.
PS087|Yeah.
PS08A|I could never do those of I never got one of those right.
PS087|I would hate to do that orally I could only do that with.
PS087|I think.
PS0XV|Yeah.
PS0XU|You can write it down by the time you've written it down and thought about it.
PS087|Should of had the answer.
PS0XU|yeah I find that that I've done it and I've written down the answer and then I can't think which number does it go to and by the time I've got to number one they're on about six so I might as well I'm lost it completely so I can't do that either and my project work course work goes towards certain percent of my marks and I can't think for the life of me why.
PS0XU|cos I don't want.
PS0XU|you get one percent on explaining how you do it.
PS0XU|so that's that I can't rely on my course work for my marks so that's.
PS0XU|I can't do it so that I've got to get full marks for the exam to pass without the other two bits on it I can't do that.
PS087|Why is the project work so.
PS08A|You don't have to have English.
PS0XU|No cos I'm old.
PS08A|Brilliant cos I.
PS0XU|pass mark I've done the work and I've.
PS08A|We've all stood teaching I've got maths I haven't got English.
PS0XV|This is is this O level.
PS0XU|A level English Language and Literature I'm doing which isn't really.
PS0XU|but I might not pass I haven't got the time and difficult when I'm working I can't.
PS0XU|if I start and it starts getting boring.
PS0XU|motivation is.
PS08A|I can do an essay to prove I can.
PS0XV|It's all too much for me.
PS087|That can go next.
PS0XU|Yeah.
PS087|They're nice.
PS087|these two really nice I like this one.
