PS0XR|It's not bad really normally.
PS087|I've a well she's dumped hers on me.
PS087|I mean she's got two children to dump on me so I don't feel bad about that in that we know we decided that's what we we didn't mind doing and there no trouble if fact they're less trouble cos they're together than they are.

PS0XR|Has Martin got chickenpox then.
PS087|Yeah anyhow I think she's hoping to come to tomorrow cos erm idea in the air that on Maundy Thursday instead of having an ordinary mums and toddlers we'll have a in church for half an hour and then a run around cups of coffee with the big toys in the hall a good idea.
PS0XR|Mm.
PS087|That'll be a nice idea it's a bit tricky you remember the Chris what we did at Christmas that went really well and we thought perhaps something similar book for Easter yeah don't know what we'll do but cos people like John and so he's not teaching full time in fact some of the schools have holiday aren't they.
PS0XR|Mm that's why I thought you wasn't doing anything on that day.
PS087|Well she wasn't going to and then the elections got in the way.
PS0XR|Got to are we having that thing.
PS087|Well we still don't know about that and it said in the paper that they're having election in the church hall nobody in the church knows about it.
PS0XR|Mm can't get it if they don't.
PS087|So if they don't act they've had it but if they wrote and asked quick then.
PS0XR|It's got to be someone with a.
PS0XR|with a caretaker hasn't it be elect them there isn't one is there.
PS087|Why a caretaker.
PS0XR|To open it up and see to it.
PS087|Why can't they.
PS0XR|don't usually.
PS087|Oh they will have to if they want to won't they.

PS0XR|you'll be up there for seven in the morning.
PS087|That's alright open it up and then what do you do keep puffing along and sweeping it up whether it's put.
