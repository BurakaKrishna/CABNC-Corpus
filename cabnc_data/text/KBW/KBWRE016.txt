PS087|well that's I thought when I saw it coming out I thought oh goodness this is gon na be ten P a week that's the same for everybody very good.
KBWPSUN|How does.
PS087|and because it's slight yellow you don't lose it you know if you keep all your stuff in it at home you can see it under the chairs and you know huh find it again We one doesn't try to lose things but they just happen don't they really I think I appreciate more now you know when I was when I was teaching I used to think oh stupid woman she's not to bring this book in and you know and now I think oh dear huh yeah and you also appreciate the people I would appreciate now those who managed to do it every day without fail manage to sort of let because they must of put themselves out no end to have.
KBWPSUN|Yes.
PS087|done it as opposed.
KBWPSUN|keep in.
PS087|to those who think oh blow I can't find it just tough mm.
PS087|no hope we don't lose it on that Tim it's got all my money in at the moment it's a really good one isn't it we're really enjoying it at the moment doesn't what number it is but we just what do we do with this.
KBWPSUN|Something seven.
PS087|Something seven sixty seven perhaps even or seventy something anyway whatever it's got money hasn't it.
PS087|It is.
KBWPSUN|well we haven't seemed to the new fiveP's.
PS087|yeah well I was gon na say those new fiveP's are but you see you just get the new fiveP's and low and behold they will produce something else.
KBWPSUN|they change hang on.
PS087|oh yes.
PS087|He's got chicken pox at the moment I think.
KBWPSUN|Oh.
PS087|I think she's probably just come out for a quick stroll we won't spend our time over that at the moment hello.
KBWPSUN|Hello.
PS087|alright.
KBWPSUN|Have they not had chicken pox.
PS087|Yes ours have yeah they probably passed it on in fact kids probably passed it to them.
KBWPSUN|Oh.
PS087|weeks ago.
KBWPSUN|I was thinking I haven't heard him cry.
KBWPSUN|Is he happier.
PS087|Tim you mean.
KBWPSUN|No that.
PS087|Oh that one.
PS087|Yes I tell you something I was amazed at erm the reading book he appeared with Fluff and Nip and goodness knows what that went out with the ark when I came out of college I don't know whether they're all reading that or whether it's just sort of found them and must of been just perhaps a one off or something but I was amazed.
PS087|no I don't think it is I think it's probably got.
PS087|yeah.
PS087|it's the moral that's right and the moral sounds sounds good doesn't it I don't know if it is but it just sounds it I suppose.
KBWPSUN|Well I I mean.
PS087|no no.
KBWPSUN|I mean I like very much.
PS087|yeah.
PS087|yeah could well be I don't know what it is.
KBWPSUN|if it's anything school.
PS087|no and I I think particularly this new head seems to know exactly what she's doing where she's going I think it's excellent so I'm sure she's working everybody to death and I think that's brilliant.
KBWPSUN|Yeah.
PS087|well I was worked to death.
KBWPSUN|if she.
PS087|when I first came out of college and I really appreciated it.
KBWPSUN|well I I I.
PS087|you know you had high standards and you knew where you were aiming for and that's what I want my kids to go through as well you know somebody who's gon na do their best.
KBWPSUN|because it rubs off on them.
PS087|mm.
KBWPSUN|it's it's everybody around them got to try hard.
PS087|that's right that's right.
KBWPSUN|you know the stuff I mean they will.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|know that's there expect.
PS087|that's right and you know that if the staff has put theirselves out to make a decent crash in their environment they're gon na go mad at the children if they muck it up so therefore you know you're gon na have that.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|I think that one of the things that get me at the moment is the time keeping it's very bad.
PS087|mm.
KBWPSUN|I mean they stroll in at quarter to nine and I think.
PS087|right right.
KBWPSUN|I think that.
PS087|it's a bit bad that.
KBWPSUN|yeah.
PS087|yeah well I was there the other day and erm the bell went and nobody sort of moved and I thought I think I know you know so I got up and I washed me cup of tea like you know they looked at me as if you know oh there's a keen but I mean I do think it's important to do that because not only that it's not fair for the.
KBWPSUN|I think the day you get I've I've.
PS087|dinner ladies because I mean they're stuck out there you know doing their best.
KBWPSUN|cos from their every angle a child needs.
PS087|yeah yeah.
KBWPSUN|cos it's I mean my two I've always been very.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|and they've never been late to their jobs.
PS087|I aim to get things there on time.
KBWPSUN|you know they've both got little jobs they've never be late and they.
PS087|mm.
KBWPSUN|have to go and.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|all that sort of thing but.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|I don't know what strolling and.
PS087|yeah you mean the children and the say rather than.
KBWPSUN|oh yeah.
PS087|the staff.
KBWPSUN|oh yes I meant the children.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|yeah I was thinking of the parent and teacher side of it.
PS087|oh yeah.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|you're waiting to go into assembly.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|I don't know it should to me every day one two children you know.
PS087|yep.
KBWPSUN|I think they're late every day.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|once or twice.
PS087|they probably don't get up until quarter to nine see they have a struggle really to get there on time.
KBWPSUN|I I if you can manage to get here for ten past nine every day why can't you manage to get here for nineo'clock.
PS087|to get here for nineo'clock every day yeah.
PS087|it's five to it says on the bits of paper.
KBWPSUN|it's five to.
PS087|but then the bell doesn't go till nine although sometimes it goes at two minutes to nine and sometimes it goes at five past nine.
KBWPSUN|I think all the clocks are.
PS087|they say something different or something do they.
KBWPSUN|yeah because I was in the.
PS087|Cos sometimes I think we've got hours and we hear bell going as we're coming up the hill and we think oh dear and then you know other times.
KBWPSUN|yeah.
PS087|we'll be sitting in the playground for ages well standing in the playground for ages.
KBWPSUN|I think sometimes these things crop up.
PS087|Yeah.
KBWPSUN|and we all get rather engrossed.
PS087|yeah.
KBWPSUN|and then everybody's gone to the classroom and you think oh gosh the bell.
KBWPSUN|anyway I.
PS087|right ok.
KBWPSUN|see you.
PS087|bye.
PS089|I have to do my own one.
