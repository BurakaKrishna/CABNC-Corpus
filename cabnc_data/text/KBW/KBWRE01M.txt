PS08A|Yeah mummy mummy the window cleaner went to rescue some people along came the fireman.
PS087|Mums and toddlers thought it was wonderful we only had half a dozen you see in there cos it was low numbers all round so we had low numbers in the.
PS087|as well had a little do with a little boy called Shane he decided he wanted to come into the story with a in his blue car I explained that on the day of the choose he could either come in and have a story or he was to play with the blue car outside well he had a fit he's rattling the door anyway I didn't realize there was this childminder that he had with him not er his mum cos she came and had her sort of say and things.
PS087|we finished the story and we got onto the rhymes I presume and a little body sidled in through the win through the door and he sort of sat there looking pathetic you know I said would you like to come and sit on my knee No he said and I went over and I picked him up anyway and sat him on I sat him on my knee and I said we'll just do some rhymes and I could feel him sort of going mm mm mm like they do all pathetic and whiny anyway Phyllis arrived and afterwards it was by then he had calmed down and he was fine and I said wan na read the story now cos he missed it of course when he decided he couldn't do without his car so I said next week perhaps come without your car I think I'd won him over by the end but it was a bit hairy.
PS088|Mum.
PS087|Especially as the childminder hadn't seen what had happened so she didn't realize why he was carrying on like he was made the whole thing a little bit tricky can I give you this It hasn't.
