PS087|Very wise.
PS08A|So I don't know whether this one will have pips in it so be careful.
PS088|Daddy.
PS087|I would think the oranges will have pips in won't they Usually do.
PS08A|Oh they usually do.
PS088|I think these have pips in.
PS087|Mm Orange pips are slightly bigger than satsuma pips so you can see them.
PS089|Yeah but sat the satsuma pip was really big.
PS08A|They were quite big.
PS089|Actually I got it in my mouth.
PS08A|Did you.

PS089|No but all they do they leave the orange in the skin.
PS08A|Oh I see they don't peel it.
PS087|And you have to suck it out Oh That's probably cos it would take them too long to peel everybody's oranges wouldn't it.
