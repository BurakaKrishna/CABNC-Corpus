PS1DW|There could be no doubt in the mind of John that Jesus had been sent by God.
PS1DW|So what happened when Jesus was thirty years old.
PS1DW|Erm he erm he ha he went to John the Baptist to baptize to ask him to be baptized.
PS1DW|Yeah that's right very good so nine by pouring out this holy spirit and Jesus Jehovah was er knighting him or appointing him to be the king of this coming kingdom thing thus have anointed with the spirit Jesus became the Messiah which words in the Hebrew and Greek languages mean appoint a anointed therefore he became in fact Jesus Christ or Jesus the United so so it was Apostle Peter spoke of Jesus who was from Nazareth Nazareth how about anointed them but all the spirit and power also by his baptism and water Jesus was presenting himself to God to carry out the work that God had sent him to earth to do what was that important work So mine asks when did Jesus in fact become Christ And why then.
PS1DW|Er when he was baptized.
PS1DW|And Peter says by his baptism what was Jesus presented himself to do.
PS1DW|To do er God's will erm.
PS1DW|Yeah.
PS1DW|with read it here hmm.
PS1DW|That's right as you say.
PS1DW|Yeah.
PS1DW|So when a person gets baptized then what what they're dedicating themselves to do God's will aren't they.
PS1DW|Yes to carry out God's work yes.
PS1DW|Were you have have you been baptized.
PS1DW|No.
PS1DW|When you was a baby.
PS1DW|Oh when I was a baby yes of course yes.
PS1DW|So when you were a little baby did you dedicate yourself to do God's will then.
PS1DW|No you're not capable are you.
PS1DW|No.
PS1DW|Er.
PS1DW|So just for us you don't even know what God's will is do you When.
PS1DW|No er.
PS1DW|you're a baby.
PS1DW|That's right.
PS1DW|and er.
PS1DW|There's something as well er er in baptism isn't there really Godparents these state that you should keep them on the straight and narrow.
PS1DW|I mean you can't guarantee that.
PS1DW|No.
PS1DW|can they.
PS1DW|and then again did Jesus have godparents.
PS1DW|No.
PS1DW|No I mean if the parents can't keep children under straight and narrow.
PS1DW|That's right yeah.
PS1DW|and don't and particularly these days they don't go seem to have all that much interest in doing so do they.
PS1DW|No no not at all.
PS1DW|So grandparents are probably even less interested you know.

PS1DW|so.
PS1DW|All the same as in my case I mean I erm er my aunt my aunt travelled to to.
