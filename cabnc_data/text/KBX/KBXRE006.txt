PS1DW|Oh right so.
KBXPS00|so.
PS1DW|you've got some questions you wanted to ask me Mark that's the end I said Mark and Mark's.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|mum just came in.
KBXPS00|Mm.
KBXPS00|I I I you're supposed to I thought you're supposed to remain anonymous.
PS1DW|Oh on there it says so.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|doesn't it right.
KBXPS00|Oh it's only first names anyway.
PS1DW|Yeah there must be a million Marks about.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|especially in Germany.
KBXPS00|Well the question related to Matthew chapter eight verses twelve.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|where it says where as the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside this is where the luck we thing the lashing of the teeth will be see which sons of the kingdom is that referring to It can't be referring to the ones the sons of the kingdom that are inheriting it is it.
PS1DW|No no.
KBXPS00|So which sons of the kingdom is he talking about.
PS1DW|That's a good question erm what what scripture is it Mark.
KBXPS00|Erm Matthew chapter eight verses twelve.
PS1DW|Let's have a look what's er surrounding er verses say.
KBXPS00|Mm it's after the army officer the army officer is asking him to treat his manservants for some.
PS1DW|yes.
KBXPS00|and then I hear him back he says that he's got great faith to believe the truth know the truth mhm mm.
PS1DW|Oh I can see you're getting me baffled this morning.
KBXPS00|Mhm it must be talking erm some other kingdom that's all I can suggest maybe.
PS1DW|Erm it says here whereas I'll read from eleven shall I.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|Many from eastern parts and western parts will come and decline at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens and erm as regards to these ones Abraham Isaac and Jacob erm at the kingdom of the heavens while these ones were born before Jesus weren't they.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|So we know from previous studies that these ones when they die haven't gone to heaven.
KBXPS00|Not initially no.
PS1DW|No.
KBXPS00|they must of done.
PS1DW|so so so yes so they will so the kingdom of heaven of the heavens it mentions well thy kingdom come on earth doesn't it on.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|so bearing that in mind let's see what it says at verse twelve whereas the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the darkness well there will be some of the sons of the kingdom thrown into the darkness outside because this this proved futile they they haven't er lived in faith have they Some of them gone away from the kitchen.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|er refrained outside where there is where they're weeping and.
KBXPS00|Er another scripture here to suggest whether this this is on the same sort of er apart from that's it chapter thirteen and Luke.
PS1DW|Hold on just a sec.
KBXPS00|chapter thirteen have you got the volume too high there.
PS1DW|I think perhaps I have haven't I.
KBXPS00|Mm you've got the volume too high yeah you won't get you'll get your feedback that means you've got the volume too high where's the volume.
PS1DW|Yeah it's on eight now shall I put it on.
KBXPS00|Oh you've got it miles too high yeah you've got it miles too high that's why you're getting feedback turn it right down right down to about number two or three or something like that.
PS1DW|Oh we won't be able to hear.
KBXPS00|Well you don't want to hear what you.
PS1DW|Yeah read some of that then eh.
KBXPS00|you don't want to hear too much of what you're recording anyway do you.
PS1DW|Erm.
KBXPS00|Yeah this is in Luke chapter thirteen.
PS1DW|Matthew Mark Luke and John Luke Luke thirteen yes.
KBXPS00|and probably if you go from about twenty five or somewhere round there you'll get the context of it.
PS1DW|Yeah twenty five says when once the householder has got up and locked the door and you start to stand outside and knock at the door saying sir open to us but in answer he will say to you I do not know where you are from then you will start saying we ate and drank in front of you and we've taught in our broad ways but he will speak and say to you I do not know where you are from get away from me you are workers of unrighteousness.
KBXPS00|Mm this one now there is where you'll.
PS1DW|there is where your whipping and the gnashing of your teeth will be when you see Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God.
KBXPS00|in the kingdom of God but your half of it's thrown outside.
PS1DW|Yes but you'll also be going outside yes.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|erm.
KBXPS00|that mentions Abraham Isaac and Jacob there again doesn't it.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|I'm just wondering if there that's related to that scripture that I've just showed you.
PS1DW|Oh yes.
KBXPS00|It seems to be on the same lines don't it.
PS1DW|Yes because Matthew Mark Luke and John were all witnesses of Jes Jesus' ministry on the earth weren't they.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|And erm they recorded different things but Mat but also they recorded the same things as well.
KBXPS00|Mm see the relation is also the sons of the kingdom will be the ones where the gnashing of the teeth er er will be.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|outside the kingdom then.
PS1DW|yes yes that's why it tells us in verse twenty four of Luke thirteen ex exert yourself vigorously to get in through the narrow door.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|because many I tell you will seek to get in but will not be able.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|So.
KBXPS00|going back to the the other chapter.
PS1DW|See we if I can just say Mark now you and I know this truth pe pe people in the world generally don't know what you and I know do they That's why the.
PS1DW|of the kingdom must go from door to door from city to city from village to village they don't know about it but once we do know about it then we're sort of accountable aren't we.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|That's right yes.
KBXPS00|responsible yeah.
PS1DW|we don't want to be like these ones that erm got to know and it and er that have done away it says erm that's where the gnashing and at the tooth will be thrown outside.
KBXPS00|You see this one in chapter page of Matthew and verse twelve as I mentioned I was just wondering if some if that's got something to do with the faith of the army officers or something like cos.
PS1DW|Oh yes I think erm.
KBXPS00|whether it's related to that particular thing.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|you know.
PS1DW|well it well it would be but it's a set pattern for us as we are today.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|Yes the army officers shall we just read a bit more of that bit.
KBXPS00|Mm a bit further back probably.
PS1DW|Yeah just to get the picture of it.
KBXPS00|Mm cos it's got in relation to that ain't it Somehow or other.
PS1DW|Yes that's.
KBXPS00|it's sort of in relation to it there must of been some reason why he said that to take them to hear more to other people.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|must of had a bearing on him saying that.
PS1DW|Oh yes I think the story is that Matthew heard this voice shall we just read from there.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|Because then Jesus said to him who was he talking to let's let's start off on the verse one after er after he had come down from the mountains great crowds followed him that's Jesus isn't it.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|and with a leprous man came over and began doing a to him saying Lord if you just want to you can make me clean and so stretching out his hand he touched him saying I want to be made clean and immediately his leprosy was vanished away then Jesus said to him see that you tell no one but go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses appointed for the purpose of a witness to them when he entered into Calpurnia that's the other two that the other.
PS1DW|isn't it.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|When he entered into Calpurnia an army officer came to him and tricking him and saying sir my manservant is laid up in the house with paralysis being terribly tormented he said to him when I get there I will cure her in reply the army officer said sir I am not a fit man for you to enter under my roof but just say the word and my manservant will be healed.
KBXPS00|That's the old faith int it.
PS1DW|Exactly Jesus was saying to this officer that I'll cure your master when I get there.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|but what but what marvellous faith he must of had.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|Yes you say they were they.
KBXPS00|Mm yeah.
PS1DW|hadn't got to be there and he could be cured.
KBXPS00|Mm yeah.
PS1DW|that's right Mark yes.
KBXPS00|He had the faith that's the main thing int it.
PS1DW|Yes er it goes on to say erm for I too am a man placed under authority having soldiers under me see Jesus was a man of authority the other officer was saying the same.
KBXPS00|Mm the bribery yeah.
PS1DW|Mm that's right and I say to this one be on your way and he's on his way and to another come and he comes and to my slave dither and he does it Hearing that Jesus became amazed and said to those following him I tell you the truth but no one in Israel have I faced to a greater face so that's quite some statement that Jesus has made.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|now we don't learn a lot about we don't know much about this army officer except what we've just read and even though the we we know of quite a few people in the bible he says in Israel there's no one with greater faith than this army officer so he's quite some man isn't he.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|Yes very good.
KBXPS00|but we haven't erm gone to to explain why he's mentioned that particular point in chapter twelve.
PS1DW|Erm in.
KBXPS00|In what relation is that you know tie in to that particular great faith that he had.
PS1DW|I I'll go on reading then from eleven shall I But I tell you that many from eastern parts and western parts would come and recline at the table with Abraham Isaac and Jacob and the kingdom of the heavens whereas the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into darkness outside that there is where the weaken and the nation of the two.
KBXPS00|so what's that got to do with that particular that.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|faith which he had.
PS1DW|Yeah well.
KBXPS00|There must of been some particular reason why why why he mentioned that which maybe might be difficult to try and realize.
PS1DW|Yes I can see your point Mark I see.
KBXPS00|you know in other words it might take a bit of time to work it out there is some reason why he must of said that mustn't didn't he.
PS1DW|Yes why did he go on to speak about this.
KBXPS00|Mm in other words why did why did he continue in chapter eleven go on about there will be many in eastern parts will come and required at the table or in other words in the kingdom.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|there must of been some relation problem with each other the earlier erm thing.
PS1DW|When it's asked when it says I tell you mainly from the eastern parts and western parts well we're from the western parts aren't we.
KBXPS00|Mm mm.
PS1DW|In other words it's it's sticking from east to west people will know of all the thing it's er tell you that many from eastern parts and western parts were called and reclined at the table in other words this well this good news that Jesus was sticking on this.
KBXPS00|Ah I think I know why he mentioned that then.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|because that required faith at the same sort as the army officer had.
PS1DW|Yes and the.
KBXPS00|and the ones that had been cast out would be without that thing so that's why it's gone in relation to that it's because those that didn't have the faith that the army officer had would be cast out as the sons of the sons of the kingdom that's why he mentioned it in likeness.
PS1DW|The the type.
KBXPS00|there.
PS1DW|of faith.
KBXPS00|That's right you.
PS1DW|but.
KBXPS00|needed that same type of faith as he had that's why he said that er those without that faith would be cast into darkness.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|that's why he said related to it somehow.
PS1DW|Yes not that you've all had that same faith as the other officer had.
KBXPS00|Mm cos there that chapter thirteen.
PS1DW|but not to that degree degree yeah.
KBXPS00|Mm it carries on of the same account there then he said to the army officer you see.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|go just as it has been your faith.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|so let it come to pass for you and the manservant were yield so that particular was all about faith so.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|those without the faith in the certain sons of the kingdom will be cast out.
PS1DW|Yes now that kingdom is is in the Lord's prayer as we mentioned is gone into the air and.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|and everybody will have an opportunity of learning about that kingdom.
KBXPS00|Mm you see at the end of the day one has to work out if this is gon na be an earthly er point towards the kingdom that's the different between this faith and any other faith isn't it Any other faith doesn't believe there's gon na be an earth left does do they They be.
PS1DW|Has a yes.
KBXPS00|they believe it's all going to be in a story don't they Basically.
PS1DW|Yes a lot of people will read that yes.
KBXPS00|but you see unless the day was cut short no flesh would be saved anyway so it proves in Matthew that there is gon na be some flesh left.
PS1DW|Yes that's right.
KBXPS00|and as we've learnt in first Corinthians chapter fifteen that all different animals have different sorts of flesh we've got different flesh than than different animals haven't we.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|than than dogs and fish have got different flesh.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|so that the new flesh that we require will be a different sort of flesh than we've got now probably in the new order or whatever it is you know we might require a different sort of flesh mightn't we.
PS1DW|Well if we.
KBXPS00|Which is more but let's face it at the moment wears out as it grows older doesn't it.
PS1DW|Aye do you know why that is don't you.
KBXPS00|Cos it's cos of the sin obviously.
PS1DW|The sin of element passed.
KBXPS00|that been broken yeah.
PS1DW|passed down towards us that's right.
KBXPS00|Yeah.
PS1DW|but and this kingdom takes over Jesus was a ransom sacrifice he brought bought people back that's those that have faith so in the new when this new system comes round when the king comes round the earth we'll start to grow young again and then that way we'll have a sort of a different flesh won't we.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|When we grow young again.
KBXPS00|Mhm it'll be you see you are if you I think if you believe in in God which is the main point of the thing then you can believe who's capable of anything.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|I mean you've got to bear in mind that God created the the heavens and and the earth and any human that's er in God's memory who's is deceased out the way if you've got enough faith you can believe that you can bring anything back.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|if you've got the faith if you believe in God in other words you've got the faith.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|you've got to believe in God first before you can get the faith.
PS1DW|Exactly.
KBXPS00|you know what I mean.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|so if you do believe then well then you can believe that anything's possible.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|with God.
PS1DW|Well you've only got to go back to what we've been discussing and Jesus.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|when he was on the earth he cured that.
KBXPS00|didn't he.
PS1DW|Mhm.
KBXPS00|For somebody to doubt there will be urge of people on in paradise it's doubting God's power isn't it.
PS1DW|Exactly.
KBXPS00|Mm so people that just believe that you're going to heaven haven't quite got the faith to believe that there'll be people on earth as well.
PS1DW|Exactly yes.
KBXPS00|well anything's possible with God cos he created everything if he's created the stars and the moon and and the heavens then he can create whatever he wants to.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|it's up to him isn't it in a way.
PS1DW|Yes that's right.
KBXPS00|that ultimate thing.
PS1DW|Yes indeed being as he's a God as well.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|he's only got erm well I mean provisions and store for those whose artist complete towards them.
KBXPS00|Mm and that and that at the end of the day I suppose there has to be a point for the kingdom and it wasn't easy to get into that because all the the the accounts are all about how big a struggle it is to get into the kingdom.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|which proves that it wouldn't be easy to get in there anyway so.
PS1DW|No.
KBXPS00|it isn't granted automatically it's something that has to be worked out because it's not easy to get there it's a narrow gate.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|so did the automatic thing which proves that it takes a bit of time and patience before you've achieved this.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|it isn't like an immortal soul which is sort of given automatically.
PS1DW|That's right yeah.
KBXPS00|you have to have faith don't you.
PS1DW|Yes yes mm and with all the different.
PS1DW|about God that they are on the earth today.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|which are literally thousands of them.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|they contradict each other they fight each other they kill each other.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|all in the name of God and the very thing that God has said don't do.
KBXPS00|mm.
PS1DW|So if religion really is the biggest conflict that's ever been devised.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|to to there's people plenty serving God well actually they're serving the devil.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|Mm and a lot of er the religions believe in things that er aren't true like Santa Claus.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|and things like that that is a lie.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|it's not truth is it.
PS1DW|It isn't.
KBXPS00|So a lot of a lot of them tell like fairy tales a lot of people tell fairy tales for young at young children it's all aimed at young children when they're not old enough to understand what's truth and what isn't they're not old they're not in their own understanding yet when they're children so they sort of not in their conscious sense anyway.
PS1DW|What.
KBXPS00|but you.
PS1DW|what did the Catholic policeman say give me a boy until he's seven and I'll give you the man.
KBXPS00|Mhm it's all it's all you see at the end of the day it'll be the ones that that are in charge of erm.
KBXPS00|got to get the worse judgement because they are more responsible.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|got to be the ones that are in charge in other words the ones that have been mislead God might overlook because they didn't know that they were probably being mislead.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|you see what I mean.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|In other words they weren't in the.
KBXPS00|explained.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|because.
KBXPS00|says to him but we're not blind also are we And then he replied that well just because you think you're not blind then you must be.
PS1DW|Mm.
KBXPS00|you know like it's reversed they thought they they the words so they must of been if that's how it is.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|just when you you you think you're not lying you probably are.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|and when you think you are you're probably not.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|it's like.
PS1DW|So.
KBXPS00|a two way thing you know.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|one after the.
PS1DW|but it if everybody has the opportunities listening to the good news of the kingdom in the in the old world well then people have a chance that means a everybody's having a chance doesn't it.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|If you mention like if people don't hear this how will they well it says in Romans doesn't it Romans just have a look at Romans ten Romans chapter ten.
KBXPSUN|Excuse me Mark.
KBXPS00|Mm.
KBXPS00|a bit later yeah.
KBXPSUN|Yes alright sorry for interrupting you.
KBXPS00|No it's alright keep talking.
PS1DW|Yeah it says Romans ten verse thirteen for every everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved however how will they call on him if in him they'd not put faith how in turn will they put faith in him if him they've not heard how in turn will they hear without someone to preach how in turn will they preach unless they've been sent forth just as it is written how come we are at the feet of those who declare good news of good things well that's more or less what we were saying isn't it.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|People have have got to have this opportunity to listen to the good news erm.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|if if they refuse well that's that's a choice they have isn't it.
KBXPS00|Mm see one of the dangers of just reading the bible is that you have to be careful you don't fall into the pitfall of just reading it when if you do then it'll all look as if it's pointing towards the only way out is heaven.
PS1DW|Yes and you've got the time.
KBXPS00|because all the scriptures in the first gospel are all pushing in how to get to that place.
PS1DW|That's right cos these first ones sorry for interrupting Mark go on.
KBXPS00|Mm yeah the all the scriptures from then on even are all pointed out to achieve this heavenly thing.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|but er at the end of the day there has to be a purpose for it so unless you you you put it into action then you if you just read then you're in danger of having a bigger judgment than somebody that was ignorant.
PS1DW|Mm.
KBXPS00|you know of not knowing so that the responsibility becomes higher the more you learn.
PS1DW|Yes more have came to me that's right.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|and erm in erm speaking about it however and in mentioning about the scriptures which referring about them.
KBXPS00|Mm most of them do don't they Most of the scriptures are all out out to achieve that because they had to acha achieve perfection at the end of the day didn't they.
PS1DW|But what which ones are going to heaven Everybody.
KBXPS00|Well the scriptures really mention how a man drives for the kingdom of God so mainly it's the man I don't know whether women go to the the heavenly ground it doesn't actually mention that does it anywhere.
PS1DW|Well the amended ones.
KBXPS00|Mm are they men or or are they known to all women.
PS1DW|Both aren't they.
KBXPS00|I don't know er sort of.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|question that I meant to meant to ask which I don't know whether there are women there cos mainly the scriptures mentioned about it's the man that's got the lead isn't it.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|You very rarely talk about women going to heaven.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|do they.
PS1DW|Well it the reason you know the reason why some are going to heaven when you think of a kingdom.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|and you think of our country here in England.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|you've got there's the queen she's the head of the country.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|and she to help her to run the country she's got a parliament.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|now in heaven Jesus is the king and Jesus will will have a certain number with him in heaven to rule over the earth a.
PS1DW|with him.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|and these ones will be made up er faithful ones from taken from Jesus'.
PS1DW|they'll be made up of faithful ones that er will will have to die they'll have to shove their flesh with.
PS1DW|to go to heaven to be part of this kingdom but for the rest of mankind which are obedient which do accept er the truth they will live in paradise on the earth.
KBXPS00|Mm you see a lot of the er the English scriptures talk about the the paradise in in its right context you can just examine the the the Christian script which you might get confused because there's a lot of er things that can take them both ways.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|like for instance chapter ten of John verse sixteen which talks about other sheep which are not of this fold you you might think that er that's talking about what er the logical sense of that scripture is that the dividing line with sheep and you get different sort of folds don't you.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|So at that time that could of been taken into the context of or one anyway going to the same place.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|which only in future years that er it's added up to er significant point.
PS1DW|That's right and then er those ones those sheep which you've just mentioned er are a myth.
KBXPS00|oh mm cos one thing really gave the key away was in the the sermon on the mount where Jesus said that the meek ought ought to inherit the earth.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|which proves that er that it's a separate class.
PS1DW|For those who are going to heaven.
KBXPS00|well mm this is the point at the end of the day to prove the truth you've got ta prove in your mind that there is gon na be a separate sort of clasp between the what there there is a scripture I think.
KBXPSUN|Come on.
KBXPS00|it's in first Corinthians it talks about for I think I'm in a vision of the third heaven which was actually a vision it wasn't a reality it's like a revelation was a vision I don't think it was the reality of heaven was it It was vision.
PS1DW|I can't comment without just looking at it Mark er I'm afraid.
KBXPS00|No there was a vision and I think the the Apostle had was of the third heaven.
PS1DW|Yes yes you may be right but I'm I'm just about erm in the dark a bit.
KBXPS00|the third heaven I thought it I think I've I've looked in the re the aid book what does the third heaven it was er it was more of a a dream more of a sym symbolic dream more than natural reality of vision of heaven do you know what I mean.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|You see a lot of the er a lot of the vision that they had.
PS1DW|Something typifying.
KBXPS00|Mm the visions that they had were not as reality they were only like visions they had.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|they weren't actually real heaven or real there's basic weren't the.
PS1DW|Oh yes yes.
KBXPS00|colourful visions.
PS1DW|oh lots of visions were were had by.
KBXPS00|Mm see that's that's the difference which have to click in your mind.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|that even in in in the revelation the very beginning chapters to of had one to about chapter seven were very easy to understand once you understand what they're saying because they're all letters to each congregation at that time weren't they.
PS1DW|Yes they were yes.
KBXPS00|They they were er the the.
KBXPS00|to the congregation of of wherever send this letter and John has to send these letters but the letters were the spirits talking.
PS1DW|That's right yes.
KBXPS00|they're all the spirits talking to them.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|giving them information.
PS1DW|Yes that's right.
KBXPS00|that's basically the sort of revelation isn't it.
PS1DW|That's right yes.
KBXPS00|And the angel whose congregation the let letters were sent to.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|one logical thing is that erm if erm letters were sent to er to angels which I don't know whether that the judges believe that then you wouldn't actually need to send the literal letters to er angels who it because they'd be far advanced in in whatever they've got.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|so you know the these one thing you'll have to work out in a logical side of revelation.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|in other words if you read it without any experience you might start thinking that it's giving you a vision of the real heaven where as it's just symbolic.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|it's all symbolism and this is one of the things you have to work out to to find out whether there is er.
PS1DW|You know can I just ask you something Talk about angels you know these are heavenly erm spirits aren't they.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|Erm now can you remember in the book of Genesis where it says sons of the true God Er they took on flesh and the you.
KBXPS00|Oh the ones that were disobedient.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|Yeah yeah.
PS1DW|an angels that turn bad just like a lot of mankind turn bad er they put on flesh then for the purpose of marrying the goodlooking daughters of men.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|now do you know anything about these fal these fallen angels have they died Or are they still about today Or what What do you know about them.
KBXPS00|Mm well obviously they've been casting bonds and tell judgment.
PS1DW|Can well can they influence us today.
KBXPS00|The de if they're demons yeah they can yeah.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|they do exist.
PS1DW|Then then the demons are these proper angels at one time.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|weren't they Fallen.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|angels.
KBXPS00|Er to to work the truth out of things one has to think what Adam Adam had lost in the beginning what Jesus had to gain back cos according to the Corinthian's letter that erm Jesus came back to buy back what Adam had lost and if you can work out what Adam had lost in the in the first place then you can see the point why you're put on the earth and you can see that it that he he was given a commandment not to take off the the tree of kno knowledge written by weren't he.
PS1DW|That's right.
KBXPS00|If he can work out that er what would of happened if he probably wouldn't of taken that.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|and what was taken away when when he did break the rule then you can work out what Jesus brought back.
PS1DW|Yes that's right then you can work that out.
KBXPS00|which was God's spirit in some way.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|what he must of lost God's spirit mustn't he Adam.
PS1DW|Oh yes.
KBXPS00|On his way.
PS1DW|yes to a large degree.
KBXPS00|mm.
PS1DW|that spirit.
KBXPS00|and that's.
PS1DW|he broke he broke the ageing process on the human race.
KBXPS00|Mm cos that's what Jesus came to buy back God's spirit.
PS1DW|That's it because he was a perfect man Jesus.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|not not like erm any descendants that would go on from Adam were born imperfect weren't they.
KBXPS00|Mm it's alright I've just seen a a woman er passing a three wheeler on the pavement here wheel chair and she was doing quite a bit of a speed I was just gon na get my my my speed checker.
KBXPS00|know of her see if she was speeding on the pavement.
PS1DW|Well getting back to these fallen angels in what way must try and lead mankind today.
KBXPS00|One of the big ways is is spiritualism and things that are not real things that are sort of er blind in the mind of the unbeliever as it were in other words material things probably and things that have under revelation.
KBXPS00|according towards the under revelation he talks about how these these dumb idols and these pieces of gold have got nothing in them and that'd be way in which the the ones would be caught out because of these gold or whatever have got nothing in them you see.
PS1DW|What what about Ouija boards.
KBXPS00|Well this is another method isn't it Er.
KBXPS00|of tricking people into believing sort of things that aren't true which they're saying that er they're talking to deceased people like people said they talked to er Elvis Presley.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|has been er one woman that claims to continuously talk to him from where he where he where he is where you know.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|so obviously she's assuming that she's talking to Elvis but er she can't prove it.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|obviously beyond that that sort of thing can't prove anyway but she's claiming to to talk to this particular singer whatever you know.
PS1DW|Lots lots of people claim in fact ever such a lot of people claim that they've got communication with the dead for instance that as you know I've got a caravan ain't I at Rudyard Lake.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|And there's a lady there and er got a caravan and her husband had died and she wanted me to swap caravans her's was actually a better condition caravan than mine.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|where it she said it was too big for her and er she wanted something smaller with a swap well I didn't swap for the reason mine was overlooking the lake it was in a better position and er then she told me the reason she wanted to swap cos er she said it was too big cos her husband had died I started to speak to her about when God's kingdom comes on the earth these dead ones will come back these loved ones.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|oh he's already with me now she says.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|he's already with me.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|and she she was absolutely sure and there's lots of people that.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|say things like that.
KBXPS00|Mm well actually when when somebody passes away lots of people say that when they pass away they've received their spirit.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|that's came to them.
PS1DW|Yes so what act so do you know Mark what it is that makes these people think those things.
KBXPS00|Well there must be another force that makes them see them things mustn't there.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|Er it isn't actually controlled by them.
PS1DW|No.
KBXPS00|it is actually some other thing.
PS1DW|and.
KBXPS00|you know.
PS1DW|and this other force is the fallen angels the demons if they they can have oh this women used to say oh he's with me he he's in bed with me at night.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|so these demons these fallen angels have got you see you've got to serve them and and those of the bible but once you're dead you go to the grave you see and that's it you're not conscious of anything at all it says.
KBXPS00|Mm what the.
PS1DW|but but these things.
KBXPS00|You've got to bear in mind though that that that the scriptures which you can use in the Hebrew context were before the resurrection was possible so you had to be careful that er that you don't bounce because when Jesus came to the earth he changed that though didn't he He he made possible for for a resurrection.
PS1DW|Oh that's right.
KBXPS00|you know what I mean.
PS1DW|Yes but only for a for a for a a few isn't it.
KBXPS00|Well obviously.
PS1DW|Relatively few and compared those that are going in the end going to another year.
KBXPS00|Well the scriptures do say that that er there are those that'll be lost.
PS1DW|Yes well in.
KBXPS00|so there's got ta be some hope for those that have have gone lost or whatever hasn't there.
PS1DW|Erm in the past.
KBXPS00|Mm no well there isn't much hope for those that rejected Jesus in his time.
PS1DW|No I'm.
KBXPS00|cos he mentioned that those were liable further to start him as a.
KBXPS00|because he was actually there at the present if they if they couldn't believe that when he was around then they've got a big problem haven't they.
PS1DW|That's right yes if they coul God's son on the earth during these.
PS1DW|and if they couldn't accept him then.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|then they're not gon na accept him any time are they.
KBXPS00|That's right so they they weren't liable anyway.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|a complete destruction.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|like er according to the the the scripture the son of destruction which I don't know whether it points towards Judas Iscariot of being one of the the sons of destruction.
PS1DW|Yeah I think what you meaning before like before Jesus' time in.
PS1DW|that's the description isn't it.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|And it says the.
PS1DW|conscious that they will die.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|but as for the dead they have conscious of nothing at all.
KBXPS00|Mm you've got to bear in mind that it is actually erm it isn't something you can take for granted it is something that is a given thing and that er it can be taken away that's the main thing but.
PS1DW|This knowledge that be true.
KBXPS00|but mm.
PS1DW|you can lose it but you can't guess.
KBXPS00|Can't guess yeah that's true.
PS1DW|That's right so as we mentioned it exert yourselves vigorously.
KBXPS00|Mm in other words it isn't an automatic immortal soul that you've got.
PS1DW|No.
KBXPS00|it's still taken it it's something that's external.
PS1DW|n naturally yes that's er that's er kitchen of maturity isn't it.
KBXPS00|Because you see.
PS1DW|I mean the soul what is the soul.
KBXPS00|the soul is the whole inside into us mainly.
PS1DW|The man himself.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|you couldn't actually have separate parts.
PS1DW|No that's right it's no shadowy thing that leaves leaves er body there.
KBXPS00|Besides.
PS1DW|does it Soul is the man.
KBXPS00|the only thing that makes you conscious of what's going on is your brain and that anyway.
PS1DW|Mm.
KBXPS00|is your faculties that know if there was something that went out it wouldn't be conscious would it it'd be unconscious so you wouldn't actually be conscious you're conscious is your brain working with your body working with your mind and everything it's that's why you're conscious when you're.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|unconscious there might be something that goes out some breath.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|but that won't be conscious you'll be unconscious.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|so that won't be conscious of anything you need eyes to see and to be conscious.
PS1DW|That's right.
KBXPS00|with your eyes closed you can't see.
PS1DW|Yes you you need.
KBXPS00|so your breath.
PS1DW|your senses don't we.
KBXPS00|That's right your breath can't see in other words.
PS1DW|No.
KBXPS00|your spirit can't actually see it's blind isn't it.
PS1DW|That's right.
KBXPS00|If you're unconscious and you can't actually physically see.
PS1DW|Yes that's right.
KBXPS00|so if there was something that went out you wouldn't actually to be able to physically see where where you're going.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|What they're getting mixed up with is the mortal soul with it is that when they're using their imagination.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|when you use your imagination you can imagine that you're somewhere else can't you And they believe that's another eye as it were towards their spirit which they think's you know it's a middle eye of of.
KBXPS00|knowledge that they be.
PS1DW|That's right yeah.
KBXPS00|at the end of the day once your eyes are shut like that you've only you've only got your imagination haven't you left.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|And they think because they've got that imagination while they're living it will still be there when when we got this is man's thinking again ain't it It this is.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|where they got their beliefs from from them thinking you know they've mixed men's thinking with with biologies and things ain't they.
PS1DW|Yeah.
KBXPS00|Philosophy and things.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|mm erm the immortal soul belief is not a physical belief it's something that's being had from from guesswork from them.
PS1DW|Well they.
KBXPS00|made a guess haven't you.
PS1DW|well for it's it's a.
PS1DW|isn't it.
KBXPS00|You've guessed in a way haven't you.
PS1DW|Mm.
KBXPS00|So it's not a bit er it's not something that's automatic.
PS1DW|No.
KBXPS00|To tell a child that he was automatically going to heaven would not be biblical.
PS1DW|No of course not.
KBXPS00|because it's not the way that er it was designed for it it was designed for something in which men pressed forward to.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|wasn't it It wasn't something that the child automatically got.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|those that haven't are less fortunate than that there must be something either for them or that they were going to heaven wasn't they.
PS1DW|That's right yes.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|yes some will make it the earth but then again some will vanish.
PS1DW|altogether.
KBXPS00|Mhm that's right yeah they will be.
PS1DW|All those who call on the name of Jehovah will be saved.
KBXPS00|It's a matter of having that faith that should be Jehovah in Romans chapter ten verse thirteen it's a matter of working out to for logic of the original verse which it came from cos that's been quoted hasn't it The apostle there that wrote that letter has quoted a verse from somewhere out of the Hebrew hasn't he.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|He must of done cos that's what they were using they were using the Hebrew scriptures to to quote on weren't they.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|So if you can go back to the original Hebrew of that particular verse then you'll find out how it's meant to be said because a normal bible vision wouldn't read God's in there it would read equals and the name of the Lord will be saved you see.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|that's the way most bible verse is today really want it.
PS1DW|Yes that's it.
KBXPS00|if they would be very difficult to get through to somebody the truth.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|and that's the that's come from the Hebrew that particular thing.
PS1DW|er yes.
KBXPS00|Mm that's erm quoted from won't it.
PS1DW|erm.
KBXPS00|two is it I don't know where that particular one.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|It was I think on the cross reference where it's er quoted from yes it's yeah.
PS1DW|Mm.
KBXPS00|two thirty two that's where that cross reference comes from you see.
PS1DW|mm.
KBXPS00|cos if you think about it the apostle source was the Hebrew scripture's that was their source wasn't it.
PS1DW|That's right and then yes.
KBXPS00|What do you so you've got to really refer to the Hebrew to find the truth haven't you.
PS1DW|Yes I and then I mean when the.
PS1DW|apostles erm then Jesus came on the scene but he was their source as well as the scriptures there.
KBXPS00|Mm that's right yeah.
PS1DW|Mm.
KBXPS00|It's like a combination isn't it In fact the what they found out the sacred secret that's enlightened them to the Hebrew though.
PS1DW|Mm.
KBXPS00|Sorry watch that.
PS1DW|Forty five minutes left on here mm.
KBXPS00|Yeah but like you say that the to find to find out the real truth you have to refer to Hebrew anyway because they found out the sacred secret of God didn't they.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|But also the the being inferred to that enlightened them on the Hebrew didn't it It must of enlightened them on what the scriptures meant by the sacred secret cos before it must of been some kind of weird mystery to them.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|all of it must but all of a sudden Jesus came along and then enlightened their minds to the scriptures so they are inspired again to write the Christian.
KBXPS00|scriptures then aren't they.
PS1DW|Oh that they knew er something of the Hebrew scriptures because they were expecting the Messiah weren't they.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|They were look they were waiting for him they were looking for him they were expecting him.
KBXPS00|Mm one er scripture which I always find very interesting is Hebrews chapter twelve verse twenty two look at that one.
PS1DW|twenty two.
KBXPS00|Mm what he's talking about is the old covenant was to do with the mountain wasn't it And it was fearsome.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|Moses was sc scared.
KBXPS00|then it says to the the apostles that they'd approached a Mount Zion and a city of a living God heavenly.
KBXPS00|and millions of angels and also a general assembly and the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens and also go with judge all and the spirit lives the brightest ones who have been made perfect now see most bible versions don't use that spiritual there they render it as spirit lives the brightest ones who have been made perfect now is that verse they're talking about the apostles then reaching up to perfection and.
KBXPS00|lives or is that talking about they've approached straight line that's already there in heaven in other words the the you know that the understanding which I have it from this bible is er that seems to be suggesting that er that's talking about apos the apostles' lives before they died our spiritual lives with brightest ones who have at that er point been made perfect by being prepared to go where they're going to.
PS1DW|mmm.
KBXPS00|in other words I'm trying to work out why this is spiritual lives and not spiritual lives you know there must be some reason why.
PS1DW|Well a person can be ever these are the difference between a spirit.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|person or a spirit being shall we say not a person a spirit being and a spiritual being see you can have a human being which is who is spiritual can't you.
KBXPS00|Mhm see that's what I'm trying to get at whether that's.
PS1DW|Spiritual lives we can have spiritual lives.
KBXPS00|Mm mm we could but if but if that ends there referring to the people on the earth or the people on the heaven or the.
PS1DW|Nah.
KBXPS00|spirits in the heaven you know what I mean you know what I'm trying to say.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|Is that verse there referring to the ones that have spiritual lives on the earth or the ones that already in in the the heaven with the spirit lives in there you know what I mean.
PS1DW|Yes oh and speaking entrentically about the congregation of the firstborn.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|will.
KBXPS00|we haven't enrolled in the heavens you see.
PS1DW|Yes so the bit it'll be part of the heavenly kingdom.
KBXPS00|Mm see they they'd actually approached all this they've approached it haven't they.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|Some bibles say that that they've come to this at the end of the day they hadn't quite had it at that point anyway cos they'd approached it cos they were still alive weren't they.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|So the correct.
KBXPS00|is to approach that.
PS1DW|Yes.
KBXPS00|you know what I mean they haven't actually got that yet because they were still alive at this point here weren't they So he's explained that this is what they've approached the heavenly Jerusalem.
PS1DW|But yes.
KBXPS00|you know.
PS1DW|but er you know these united ones on the earth today righteousness.
KBXPS00|Mm.
PS1DW|has before they go to heaven account.
KBXPS00|Mhm.
PS1DW|already accounted to them isn't it.
KBXPS00|Mm see this is a very difficult one to understand it takes a lot of er working out you see then he's also applied approached the city you see which is called the same thing isn't it.
PS1DW|Mhm.
KBXPS00|Also it's called another thing heavenly Jerusalem with millions of angels in general assembly and the congregation of the first one which is the first fruits aren't they.
