PS1EP|Yeah but I'm saying they're not paying they haven't got ta pay for that machine.
PS1EM|Who hasn't got ta pay for the machine.
PS1EP|Well if they're doing somebody by hand's doing it they haven't got that of paying for that machine.
PS1EM|Yeah but the machine could do what a hundred people could do in a day can't it The machine doesn't get tired like people do.
PS1EP|Yeah but I mean.
PS1EM|The peo the machine only goes off bad if somebody hasn't been maintaining it And all you've got ta do is with machine is put petrol or diesel or whatever it is to make and check all the oil.
PS1EP|And.
PS1EM|I know but that offsets the labour is the labour is the thing that costs a fortune.
PS1EM|Yeah.
PS1EP|Well why don't you do it all before and.
PS1EM|Well they do and they've got it in but it wants it at different times doesn't it So you can't give it fertiliser.
PS1EP|Well I still think that well say you have a big massive thing and and say it'd take a hundred people mm er I suppose the bigger it is the more economical it is But if you only had a small place it'd be more economical to have labour than it would to buy paying out thousands of pounds for machines and.
PS1EM|No you don't buy the they come round and do it for you don't they.
PS1EP|Well alright then.
PS1EM|You hire it for a day or whatever it is It costs just say for instance two hundred pounds for the tractor and and his sprayer and er the chemicals on top That's done your whole field big field Now that two hundred pound will only pay one man for a for a week to do the same thing And he's got ta do it a few times so then the cost becomes and and you like let's be fair we've had summers where it's the weeds er the weeds haven't grown but you get a wet summer and the weather warms and the wet and the weeds go peooow up like that So that's and then it doesn't stops.
PS1EP|Well alright then why can't he put bark on it.
PS1EM|Well that it costs.
PS1EP|from everywhere Do it that way.
PS1EM|But it's still costs isn't it.
PS1EM|Well then if you put a lot of bark on it and with vegetables so they want fertilizer.
PS1EP|Well.
