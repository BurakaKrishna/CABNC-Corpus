PS04H|I mean there's seven days in the week isn't there.
PS04E|I mean I mean how can people afford to do it Bet I mean I mean to my mind if they're opening on a Sunday they should bring their prices down because they're opening that extra day they're going to be taking extra revenue.
PS04B|Yeah of course they are.
PS04G|So they should be made to bring their prices down That is why they put that freeze on.
PS04B|That is why that man said you will not get any more special offers on a Fri Saturday night because they can't sell it on a Sunday so you used to see them selling things off on a Saturday fiveo'clock No more.
PS04G|Because they're opening on a Sunday and hoping that you'll go in.
PS04B|That's it.
KBEPSUN|Mm.
PS04G|and buy.
PS04B|So you won't be able to find out nothing.
PS04B|You won't forget that And I reckon they'll carry on down to Christmas.
KBEPSUN|Well they reckon that the British Standard people are going to have.
