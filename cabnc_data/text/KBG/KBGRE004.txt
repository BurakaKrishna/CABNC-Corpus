PS052|Yeah She said she hasn't I said do you bring her every week She said no she said we haven't been for ages.
PS051|That's what she said to me.
PS052|Cos I said I'm really surprised I said I thought you must come at least every week cos she seems to be so confident in the water.
PS051|She said she hadn't been for a while and erm then she said they didn't really know they wondered how she was gon na get on in the water.
PS052|Ah no she's fine Yeah cos they're not supposed to you see there again Down's Syndrome children are not supposed to be able to float Well she was doing a.
PS051|Well she had some floats on I know but.
PS052|Well she's only a tot isn't she.
PS051|Mhm.
PS052|No I thought cos I I remember reading erm I think it's her father who owns one of the bookshops in Woodbridge and he had this book on display you know he sort of erm advertised it if you like and it's it's properly published and everything but he had it as a a book available in his store and there was an advert in the Anglian about it and I remember reading that she said er that he said er cos it was his daughter who had the child that it totally knocked them for six They never dreamt that it could happen cos she wasn't in the risk age group or anything it just never crossed their minds that it might happen and they were totally well they just didn't know what to think.
PS051|Was there any explanation of it.
PS052|Really shocked No And she's o she's gone on to have a a normal little boy you see Just a fluke of nature.
PS051|Ah.
PS052|She's she's younger than me She's she's in her twenties and theoretically the the risk is.
PS051|She lo she looks older.
PS052|Yeah but she's not she's in her twenties and theoretically.
PS051|She looked about mid thirties I thought.

PS052|And er the fact that she's obviously gone on without it was awful when she was pregnant the second time round she didn't make a big thing of being pregnant but you could tell she was pregnant but I never quite liked to say to her just in case they had the amnio amnio whatever it is and decided not to go.
PS051|Aye they would have done won't they.
PS052|ahead you'd yeah but you can't have that till sixteen weeks and by then you sh you know you show don't you Anyway she's had a little boy and he's fine he's got a cold that's why he wasn't in today.

PS052|But well Evelyn was asking me about reading and writing but first of all she asked did we still go to you see and I said no I sa we s I said we decided it didn't suit him Oh she said why was that I said well we had I said I had a bit of a run in with the lady who ran it I didn't agree that he should be compelled to do singing which she thought he should I said and we had a decided it cos he Oh she said it's silly making him do that I said er very quickly I said I said don't get me wrong I said for kids who enjoy going to that sort of thing it's great and fine if it's alright.
PS052|but I don't want anybody accusing me of er.
PS051|Right.
PS052|causing bad feeling or trying to upset her trade I mean we know she's rubbish but erm I I said er I just said well the children who enjoy it enjoy it I said but he never really settled and er we felt that between us we'd got over twenty years' experience of working with children we reckoned we knew a little bit more about what makes children tick And er she agreed.
