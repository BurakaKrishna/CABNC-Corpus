PS052|You've got ta carry it around with you.
PS051|It's on volume ten.
PS052|Well it says like the microphone here look You've got to put it at chest height.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|make sure it's knocked or covered by clothing Cos if you have to brush it won't break the quality If you're at home you can put the machine and microphone on the table near where it will still pick up conversation Does that I mean work by a from now on.
PS051|Probably.
PS052|Right right and giving things away.
PS051|There's nothing to give away.
PS052|Where's your tapes.
PS051|Yeah there's a load of tapes.
PS052|It's a lot isn't it.
PS051|I think they're all I think they're ninety minutes.
PS052|Ninety minutes on each tape Good grief.
PS051|Well forty I think they're C nineties.
PS052|Well I can talk the hind leg off a donkey will.
PS051|Oh.
PS052|all that.
PS051|God.
PS051|Yes I know.
PS052|It makes you feel very.
PS051|No I don't think about it just let it run.
PS052|Look at him Well I couldn't care cos I don't like taping so I shouldn't.
PS051|Well it's never stopped you before.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|Not right now though Oh I've got a cup of tea.
PS051|No you were right what you said though about.
PS052|Mm.
PS051|Matthew.
PS052|Yeah I just it just seems to me such a complete and utter waste of of his time primarily for fifteen I mean this being identified a year earlier which we reckon it was you would think that even given all the red tape and everything else.
PS051|I'll have to look up his records at least.
PS052|You know it makes you well it makes you wonder whether something could be done without placing him for his sake Cos he's never gon na achieve anything in an ordinary class He's just got such a downer on himself.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|and he's he's got such a a negative way of looking at himself and everybody else looks at him that way now Cos he he he can not be positive he contributes nothing.
PS051|It's hard being positive.
PS052|In his own eyes.
PS051|for him isn't it.
PS052|Well it's I mean I feel sorry for him but having said.
PS051|Well I do and I don't sometimes.
PS052|well having said that although I feel sorry for him I get annoyed with him.
PS051|Yes Like I said he's his own worst enemy.
PS052|Because he wastes everybody's else's time.
PS051|And everybody else is fed up with him.
PS052|Well this is why I think he'd be better off hi his needs are not met by a class teacher And I don't think they have been for this last.
PS051|Mm we need a support teacher to go there.
PS052|for the last year But yo you need somebody who's gon na work with him every day and with an individual programme and you just can't offer that in a class.
PS051|Mm it's difficult.
PS052|The only way you can do that is if he goes to a special unit at Maidstone and works.
PS051|Well I don't think there's provision for him now you see because it's a.
PS052|Mm.
PS051|there's a term and a half left before he moves on.
PS052|Well this this is what I'm saying if it had been picked up and followed through at an earlier stage he would have been ensconced.
PS051|Oh yeah well there must have been.
PS052|and.
PS051|a problem identified earlier on but er.
PS052|Oh Well I think so I think it's been identified but I don't think it's been followed through.
PS051|Well it's like so many other things isn't it.
PS052|Yeah that's always the way though in n it I just cos when I see children like that and you know there's nothing you can really do for them you can't make up for the fact that they've got a rotten home life and that's top and bottom line that's what it is.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|You're trying to be everything and they're pushing it away cos it's not what they really want and they I mean all all you can get from him is how marvellous you're right how marvellous his brothers are and yet what I've heard of the brothers they're not.
PS051|Not much yeah.
PS052|they're not all that marvellous they're not really that much to look up.
PS051|Ah.
PS052|to.
PS051|No.
PS052|And they they've.
PS051|role model is it really.
PS052|No I suppose marvellous to the wrong things Oh well And he he was talking.
PS051|Was anything else said or acted upon or shall I use the kids who are done today ooh tha that should be done.
PS052|No I don't think so.
PS051|Done today.
PS052|No No I said erm I had a conversation with Gillian about reading about little bits of reading and I made the point that we'd said last night about him barking at print reading through words that he didn't know and not asking what they were and she said she'd noticed that And cos we had a bit of a laugh about it I don't know what I'm telling you about it for cos you hear him read anyway But she said yes she'd noticed but she said they are getting more out of this Johnny Briggs book than the other book.
PS051|Mhm.
PS052|So she's quite pleased that she's put them on to it it is difficult.
PS051|brilliant.
PS052|Sorry.
PS051|Nothing.
PS052|Mm And I saw Mrs.
PS051|Oh yes.
PS052|in the bank I went up to the bank.
PS051|And what did she have to say for herself.
PS052|She's alright I just don't feel that you know she's basically taken Robert back last night that was very kind of her and all that she said oh it's been nice to have him and erm but er Oliver and Robert had got on really well and erm that's all really.
PS051|Are you still working.
PS052|Yeah.
PS051|It's alright.
PS052|Er.
PS051|it's just some noise I heard on the tape.
PS052|oh and we were jus well we just sort of cha I was just talking about the weather she was saying how cold it was And erm and I made the point that I tipped all your lot out of I said what and I hadn't let them go in the classroom and I said it's a new thing but I said they got their coats on they're too macho to wear them that's their problem you know They've got their coats in school But we they were very good about going out I'm not going up to her again She's just gon na have to cry herself to sleep I'm afraid I've just.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|had enough of her now She's tired she's had a busy day so.
PS051|When was she last asleep.
PS052|Erm just before I came in from school and we were home by about half three But she's ready to go off really she probably would have done if Robert hadn't tipped the milk everywhere.
PS051|Was she asleep by then.
PS052|And then ranted and raved cos she probably just about going off then you see it woke her up all the fuss and kerfuffle.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|I was so mad with him for doing it So silly.
PS051|The trials and tribulations of a family life.
PS052|Mm Trials and tribulations I tell you a ou I said today when I was in school cos that's like being at home with my three year old it was just like that today being stuck in there.
PS051|I'll just go up and see to her.
PS052|Alright And try and sort her out Where's your bit of paper then you have to fill in on this About where you're working and what you're doing and who you're doing it with and how often.
PS051|The log book.
PS052|Yeah that's the word Ha.
PS051|The the log book.
PS052|Near the dictionary yeah.
PS051|I.
PS052|there's quite a few questions in n it.
PS051|You get a conversation record booklet tapes one to ten.
PS052|Where's your Sorry that was the one I was looking for.
PS051|Each side covers one side forty five minutes of a ninety minute tape.
PS052|Mind you there's been a great pause on it while you went to see to the baby.
PS051|Mm So then they're all the details and there's examples and.
PS052|So you're gon na take that out with you tomorrow When we go and buy the corn and er goat mix.
PS051|I could do.
PS052|I'm just trying to think where you what you're gon na do when I have my have my hair cut.
PS051|I don't know I'll find something.
PS052|I'll be about an hour I reckon I must find that photo as well The erm take it with me I feel I should be all philosophical and start spouting.
PS051|What about.
PS052|I du n no It sounds good.
PS051|I'm spouted out I think.
PS052|I told you that I was punned today didn't I I'd.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|suddenly forgotten it suddenly just it just didn't twig with them at all.
PS051|They didn't laugh when he mentioned then.
PS052|Yeah they they groaned at the ones we'd come up with but when it came to making their own up.
PS051|And they couldn't.
PS052|they'd come out with half of one they'd come out with things like I think you're er I du n no er not barking up the wrong tree that was the wrong one but the they'd sort of come out with half of a pun and they wouldn't finish it off like oh th this is smashing Sa and I'd say yeah but that's not a pun that's only a pun if you if you write down this is smashing said erm the robber or the smash and grab in other words the window fell in that kind of thing you know.
PS051|Well anyway how do does that link with sea.
PS052|Well we had to.

PS052|Oh they couldn't si yeah don't forget yo well I don't know why I'm telling you but you know your ri your age range They managed to get some ones on the sea but they did have a try erm a lot of them come up with the erm barking up the wrong tree said the dog you know things like that with a bit of help.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|Erm there's another one that a lot of came up with one or two had heard a few before and they all groaned and then accused you of making them all up I said no actually but that's always a lie.
PS051|Oh I thought you might say that.
PS052|So they all laughed at.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|that and then but that was quite hard really When I think about it they did ha erm but I'm fed up with talking about school Let's talk about something else.

PS051|Oh.
PS052|There wasn't anywhere else.
PS051|Wasn't it.
PS052|Cos the library was being used.
PS051|it was a quiet.

PS052|ah it feels.
PS051|and the secretary's knocking on the door the telephone rings and I got a bit of work done.
PS052|that's inhibiting as well isn't it And it's almost like crowding somebody's personal space if you go in their office And I feel that when I go in your room now very much that it is your room and I feel the same when I go in Glenys's it's her room.
PS051|Well I mean that should be.
PS052|and you're a visitor there which is as it should be.
PS051|it shouldn't be after what seven years.
PS052|Yeah But that's just it.
PS051|Never been painted never been clean and tidy.
PS052|Ah but but it's it's all to do with having your own personal space I think.

PS051|Mm.
PS052|Good Guys it gets more of outrageous every week you can't believe a word of it There's no plot to it at all it's it's just so farfetched.
PS051|Well then we'll watch Victoria Wood then.
PS052|Oh Alright then.
PS051|If you want to watch it now darling.
PS052|Well I mean I've watched that the Good Guides Guys.

PS052|The guys I watched the.
PS051|Put your teeth in.
PS052|Good Guys sa a couple of times and whether it was gon na improve or not but it hasn't Been waiting for it to get better every week and it.
PS051|Well this could be the episode.
PS052|And you've missed it.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|Cos we've been watching the repeat of Victoria Wood.
PS051|Oh yeah if we see.
PS052|Why is that Care Bear down there has she had it out the bath.
PS051|Probably.
PS052|difficult to sleep in n it.
PS051|No you tell them I'm fed up of telling kids off today.
PS052|You haven't had any to look after today None of your kids.
PS051|This week I have.
PS052|Mm I didn't have no didn't have any complaints at dinner time.
PS051|Oh I don't care Sue I'm not bothered.
PS052|Mm That's alright then Oh one of the hens got erm landed on the top of the black net cos I I'd put some corn and stuff in you see and she landed on it and she got her feet stuck through netting so she was flapping and the net was just going up and down.
PS051|It's quite er.
PS052|No that that'll give way that will be alright Now as she I flapped it I got hold of it and I flapped it so it I sort of bounced about she sort of bumped along.
PS051|Yeah you have to.
PS052|until she got onto that crossbar and then she just flew straight back and did exactly the same thing all over again and I just thought sod it I left her on there.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|And that she'll just have to take a chance tonight Cos she saw me putting the corn in and she decided she'd try and get it by diving through the black net instead of going through the gate like with a normal hen you know this one's obviously brain dead or.
PS051|They are stupid that lot.
PS052|They are silly Mum said they'd been all over today Dad opened the front door and he said there was a troop of them walking up the path He said he just said get out of it They all we turned round and went the other way again.
PS051|Surprising that he'd talked back to them yes.
PS052|Yeah But the I mean I came home and they were under the hedge they weren't going through but there's a big piece of netting has come down and it needs erm stitching up and then it needs sewing not sewing erm.
PS051|That's alright if it's fine let me do that.
PS052|i but it needs two of us it needs somebody on the inside and somebody on the out just to stop them flying through it Cos the the the the cock was on the back door this morning crowing.
PS051|Somebody there was crowing at about half past twelve quarter to one this morning There were two of them crowing their heads off.
PS052|Oh I never heard them.
PS051|Yes.
PS052|Oh God we'll be popular round here won't we.
PS051|That's what I thought.
PS052|I never heard them Carl.
PS051|I mean you're not locking him in any more are you You're not shutting the door.
PS052|Well I I hadn't been shutting the one that don't make no difference still there's only cos Pavarotti's out anyway Cos he he won't.
PS051|Yeah but you don't let the other two I mean it's.
PS052|I ought to perhaps we ought to start closing them in again then that'll keep.
PS051|Yeah perhaps you ought to.
PS052|them quiet But the trouble was with closing them in not so much on the but on the old flock it was so warped the wood with being damp and wet and frosty it was freezing across every night and it was nearly taking my fingers off.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|getting it open in the morning that really hurt.
PS051|Well put a little loo loop or something there.
PS052|It's too too rotten the wood But I've got what I've got ta do is repair that other coop.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|and get that there and then it'll be a lot easier cos mum said she struggled today to get in that door of the I said well what do you go in there for And she was going in for eggs or something said well I usually leave them a day or two in the winter cos it doesn't hurt and she said she struggled and struggled with that door She said it hasn't got any at the minute I said well no cos it was on like strings but er that does need fixing But it's just been too wet and too nasty to do anything about it so when we've got a chance we'll have to really do She said she's looking forward to the day that we get it fixed Said oh I'm sorry mum I'll go and get you some eggs Cos they are quite tame I mean that's one thing about the hens I mean they can't come out though they just wander about And it but the erm the goats apparently were no problem today they just stayed on and gave them a few bits and pieces you know so that was fair enough Oh I wish she'd hurry up and go to sleep.
PS051|I think I'll have to put her down again then.
PS052|Put her down.
PS052|I can't understand it I mean she's she's been up and been busy and she's had a warm bath and she's had a bottle of.
PS051|She'll start this caper again though.
PS052|Yeah coming in at night I wo well she was awake in the middle of the night I don't know what time it was but all I could hear was mummy mummy mummy.
PS051|Why didn't you just put her back into bed.
PS052|And I lay her down and she bawls.
PS051|Well it doesn't matter I didn't hear her.
PS052|Well I heard her And I feel really guilty I think oh I better bring her in and then she wakes me up at sixo'clock bouncing on the bed So And o also when it's the day before I I'm working I'm very conscience that I don't want her to be upset in the morning same with Christopher I don't want any upsets in the morning I don't want her frazzled and I don't want him upset in the morning cos I wan na go out and have a nice even keel then.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|and not have to worry that they're er gon na be a problem for mum.
PS051|Yeah.
