PS051|What these.
PS052|Well if they were oh unless he's uncovered them.
PS051|These have been here for months.
PS051|Sue.
PS052|Well perhaps we didn't come this way then the other day.
PS052|Anyway they're nice old bales though I wouldn't mind a few of them Well I was looking out the other side cos I was trying to work out where Glynis lived.
PS051|You were looking at the lambs We didn't come this way Glynis doesn't.
PS052|Oh that's right.
PS051|live along this side.
PS052|No she doesn't does she.
PS051|So you're not even in the right place.
PS052|That explains why I couldn't see where she lived.
PS051|That's correct.
PS052|That's quite nice tiles again though.
PS051|Yeah nice house.
PS052|It makes you think of summer dun n it You know you look out and see the sunshine and the illusion of warmth cos you're we're in the car.
PS051|It's warm in the car.
PS052|Yeah Be nice in the summer and just put instead of doing her up in all these great big snowsuits you know.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|Just put a little sunfrock and T-shirt and that hat on which I know she won't keep on.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|And sandals and no socks that'll be lovely I hope by then that I'll have her you know that she'll be dry In fact I had thought once she gets over this erm tooth coming through that I might erm start trying to potty train her.
PS051|Mhm.
PS052|See if she's interested you know to see if she's ready I got a few little pairs of knickers there I'd have to get her some more though.
PS051|Yeah Good idea.
PS052|I ought to start really really and truly I ought to start buying them in now in sort of double double packs you know get two cos they're expensive to buy Sort of three pounds for a couple of little little pairs of knickers and that and that's a lot when you think they when she first starts she's gon na be getting through seven or eight pairs a day.
PS051|I know.
PS052|You know you you sort of think well have to have plenty in I've got some up in the suitcase which I can use but Oh I I'll have a look I I still like the Ladybird ones best they wash nice.
PS053|Andrew I will remember you remember you in the weeks all the weeks.
PS053|you know what I would open the door and I would say look that's Andrew.
PS052|Half an hour later Christopher comes up with a joke.
PS051|That's one way of getting the joke yes.
PS052|Yeah Have you got anywhere t.
PS056|What's that black paper up there for mummy.
PS052|Where.
PS056|There on the window.
PS052|Oh somebody took all our lovely parking ticket display off that was keeping the tas tax disk up and replaced it with black tape It was either Nan or Grandpat Who was it.
PS056|I don't know.
PS051|Probably your dad.
PS052|Yeah.
PS056|I never did it.
PS052|Oh I know you didn't do it.
PS051|Open your window a little bit Robert let some fresh air into the back.
PS056|It's nice.
PS051|Bit more.
PS056|ain't it.
PS052|Or even isn't it.
PS051|That's it Good lad.
PS052|Speak posh sometimes We never did afford our meal did we We gaily thought oh yes we'll have enough money to pay for a meal.
PS052|we can't afford it now Never mind Maybe we should earmark perhaps my birthday to go out Arrange it in advance you know.
PS051|Mm I don't like the thought of anybody else come to babysit though personally.
PS052|No but.
PS051|I know people keep saying oh we'll do it for you but.
PS052|We'll do it we yeah I know Well the thing is if I arrange it for May I can ring er talk to mum and see if she'll do it.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|and do it that way I don't know what day my birthday's on this year Oh it's still Christopher's birthday anyway didn't mean to start talking about mine only as a means for having a meal out.
PS051|Oh whee.
PS052|Mind if he's coughing like that erm don't know Don't suppose I'd get in the surgery tomorrow now If it's just a cough to go with the cold then there's nothing they can do anyway but if it's an asthmatic cough then I can give him some erm Ventolin.
PS051|That's what he's had before.
PS052|He is wheezier but.
PS051|He's had it for a week.
PS052|Mind I hadn't noticed I must be a terrible mother I just haven't noticed.
PS051|You're used to it.
PS052|Well He doesn't get them quite as frequently now though as he did.
PS051|No.
PS052|Not quite cos I mean at one time when he was Christopher's age god he was never free from cold was he We'd have a respite of about a fortnight if we were lucky before he went down with the next one.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|In fact I remember I took him out of school for nearly three weeks to try and.
PS051|Get rid of the bro.
PS052|ge get his health yeah.
PS051|bronchial infection that he had.
PS052|Yeah that's right And also because I didn't think they were doing that much there with him anyway I reckon he learnt more in that three weeks at home than he ever did there.
PS052|Yeah ring up make an appointment for Dr He's sometimes easier to get into Chris hasn't been too bad though his ears have been reasonable.
PS051|Is he still on medicine or not.
PS052|Well it's there I stopped I stopped using it I must admit.
PS051|Why.
PS052|Well it made him drowsy for one thing it kept knocking him out And er he could hear me perfectly well I thought well it's there for next time Soon as th there's any slightest hint of hearing loss I can In a way though perverse though it sounds I'd rather let it get fairly bad and take him back.
PS051|Mhm.
PS052|because it's only by that way that if if he's gon na need the grommets or something in his ear then he really needs to get it sorted out this year.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|I don't want him to start in the January and then have to be off school for three weeks because.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|he's got to go to hospital to have his ears done and things like this you know If it's gon na plague him and give him trouble let's get it sorted out this year even if it means that he has a little bit of temporary deafness for a little while you know Oh dear.
PS056|Mummy what's the erm water tower near the erm.
PS052|I don't know what you mean Robert.
PS052|Oh erm jumbo.
PS056|Jumbo What's the erm cinema next to the.
PS052|It's not a cinema it's the Mercury Theatre.
PS052|Where you saw the pantomime.
PS056|Yeah.
PS052|It's the Me.
PS056|forgotten the name of it.
PS052|That's the Mercury It's a nice theatre that What was here before they put these up Carl I can't remember or was it just a bit of ground.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|Wonder if Tamsin had any luck selling her house.
PS056|What I don't understand is when erm she jumped into the beauty parlour door how did erm change so quickly Change clothes.
PS051|It was somebody else Robert who was in there already.
PS056|Oh.
PS052|Yeah it's all all very clever Yes it's what pantomime's all about Thinking on your feet improvisation It's great I enjoyed doing pantomime Oh I wasn't a very convincing Prince Charming though don't think I'd do it again.
PS051|You did your best had a go.
PS052|Had a go Wasn't me I'm better backstage I'm better writing things and than on the st on the stage I'm not enough of a strutter anyway.
PS051|Oh you've got ta be a poser.
PS052|Oh I I enjoy.
PS051|You did okay You.
PS052|I did it Well I I enjoyed it when I was at college I used to enjoy drama there.
PS051|Not the same as putting on a big performance though is it.
PS052|No it's a bit different When you put the and that's the difference about drama at college is you're doing it to please yourself and the the group that you're in with and ultimately I suppose your tutor but when you do something like a pantomime when you're doing it to please the punters.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|I think the bravest thing I ever did in my life was sing solo at that pantomime I I think that was braver than giving birth or having my wisdom teeth out.
PS051|I think you sang quite well.
PS052|The bravest thing I ever did.
PS051|You sang quite well for.
PS052|It's one of m it's one of my me memories I've erm hidden well not hidden away but tucked away to look at in.
PS051|In a later.
PS052|later years say well okay I I haven't got a fantastic voice but I did it and that was the bravest thing I did cos I know I haven't.
PS051|Anna's voice isn't much better.
PS052|know I haven't got a fantastic voice.
