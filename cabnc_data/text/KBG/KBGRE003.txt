PS051|Is that mud on the road Yeah it is.
PS052|That's a nice house.
PS051|Yeah it's the farmhouse in n it.

PS056|Barry.
PS051|Sorry Robert.
PS056|Barry.
PS051|Who's Barry.
PS056|Monkey.
PS051|Oh the chimp yeah.
PS051|Barry the monkey yes I know who you mean Little toy.
PS054|Oh did you see that.
PS052|What was it.
PS052|That's a nice house isn't it Oh I didn't realize the shop had closed.
PS051|Oh I don't I think so.
PS051|I think it's been closed for a long time actually.
PS052|Getting on with that aren't they.
PS051|Doing a good job.
PS052|Do you fancy that then.
PS051|What.
PS052|That house there.
PS051|Oh somebody'll be doing it up themselves It'll be a smart house.
PS052|Erm on a bad bend though in n it.
PS051|Er not really.
PS052|Yeah that's where the shop used to be you're right yeah Yeah it is shut yeah Yeah.
PS051|oh been closed ages that has.
PS052|Oh I never knew that there's one for sale there Carl house Mind we always said we wouldn't buy another old house didn't we.
PS051|Mm I would put in for that if it came up.
PS052|Would you.
PS051|I think so.
PS052|school.
PS051|Well it would be silly not to wouldn't it Give it a go.
PS052|Well it wouldn't be much different to what you're doing now but you may be would you be.
PS051|Well.
PS052|paid more.
PS051|Not much.
PS052|wouldn't be a lot different would it I don't know how erm.
PS051|No the only parent I knew.
PS052|Georgie.
PS051|Yes and erm.
PS052|She was pleased.
PS051|I think's dad Paul Timmy's dad was the chairman of governors.
PS052|Oh and he thought they were good did he Oh and that that little boy who was at school Nicholas he went there didn't he.
PS051|He's still there I think.
PS052|Is he Oh well she's obviously decided she likes it Either that or she's run out of schools to send him to.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|Probably a bit nearer the mark I think that's one of the drawbacks though to a village school Er it can be very nice very cosy but I.
PS051|See that also epitomizes what I was saying before you know I mean if I'm there you could be stuck there for the remainder.
PS052|teaching.
PS051|Oh yeah And there's always the danger of it could it be changed and then you've got the whole curriculum area to look after Instead of having three to look after I'd probably end up having to look after a seven or eight.
PS052|Yeah But you see I I don't know I can see what you mean but I don't know whether a move would be the answer cos I think you're if you're gon na stay in teaching this is what's gon na happen.
PS051|I mean it's there must be a time when it settles.
PS052|wherever you go wherever you go there's gon na be all this upheaval and I mean let's face it if the Tories don't get in this time and pray god they don't Labour's gon na completely.
PS051|Yeah.
PS052|alter everything that's gone before They'll keep very little in.
PS051|Yeah I know And that doesn't fill me with any great er.
PS052|But I I mean which er you you look and you think well.
PS051|Well.
PS052|which is the wor er it's gon na be bad whi whoever's in charge really.
PS051|the Scottish Nationals.
PS052|At least from the point of with Labour at least they most of them send their kids through the state system so they've got a little more idea of what they're talking about But that still boils down to the fact that everybody thinks they know how schools work cos they've been at school themselves I get really fed up with the whole.
PS051|Mm.
PS052|Seem like all we ever do is talk about schooling other people's children.
PS051|Well it's never too far from the back of your mind though is it really.
PS052|No It's funny I mean I find I'll say something I'll think oh so and so would like that and I'm about other people's kids why they're.
PS054|Oh.
PS052|Go on you naughty boy Silly thing.
PS052|Pheasant.
PS051|Yeah a pheasant ran across the road They normally do that I s it's a good job I it was in the grass verge cos I saw the.
PS052|That's the male though cos er they're a nice colour.
PS051|They're very colourful yeah.
PS054|I I saw it too.

PS052|Really.
PS051|Yeah they were drugs.
PS052|No I I no I heard a different tale I heard that he er fell out with his wife and he tried to kill her.
PS051|Oh.
PS052|I can't remember who told me but I'm sure it was sure it was that one Oh yeah it was Janet told me when we went shopping Christmas shopping She said ooh th they're talking about But whether he er whether he attempted to kill her and managed it I don't know but that that was what I heard anyway.
PS051|Carrots there look.
KBGPSUN|Oh yeah.
PS052|Oh a lot there isn't there.
PS051|Do you wan na buy a carrot when we get back.
