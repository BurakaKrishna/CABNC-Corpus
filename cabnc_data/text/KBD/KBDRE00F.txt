PS03W|Yeah.
PS03X|meeting with the leader of the Labour group who's supposedly doing all this to protect his wife The reason he's married to her I mean even I could I could really throw the dirt at them by saying that I'll you know if there is a conspiracy there's a person here who's been involved in a very iffy part of the budget who all of a sudden after ten years of slagging off the town clerk all of a sudden he's totally on the town clerk's side together with Councillor Why The only person who's involved in both allowing the town clerk to take these decisions without any interference at all.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03X|and now conspiring with a senior employee of the council and of course Just not so.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03X|All of a sudden this erm worry about this budget heading is being swept under the carpets and everybody being told is all in been er cleared up It's Dave I'd fire him.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03X|I could really make this into a very great conspiracy for.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03X|Apart from which this meeting that they're supposed to be going to have is totally out of order anyway Cos nobody's been sent any notices for it or notified about it So I mean I I could.
PS03W|What the hell are they doing now.
PS03X|get the full meeting cance I mean you get Ashdown yesterday his party rally round him like.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03X|royalty's going of fashion You get I mean Dave and Steve alright they've never been my favourite people but all this pious with Dave how much he hates the town clerk and whatever opportunity he could get he would.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03X|take.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03X|First opportunity real opportunity he gets he's doing everything the town clerk wants him to do.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03X|I just I I honestly Barry I've got to the stage where I believe in this conspiracy.
PS03W|Mm Well certainly some people want some answers want to be given on this budget er me as well I mean he can't just suddenly say.
PS03X|Well.
PS03W|it's all been sorted out don't worry about it.

PS03W|And how long Well I park.
PS03X|I'll put.
PS03W|er.
PS03X|I'll drop you off Cos I want to go home and I've got to home cos I've I've a stack of paperwork on my table I'm not gon na be able to set off much later on remember because.

PS03X|They.
PS03W|they can only be doing damage to th to the election chances I mean.
PS03X|Well they.
PS03W|they can't be achieving anything else.
PS03X|I mean saying things like a successor has already been identified I mean it's just stupid Cos the general view in Morecambe isn't what they say it is.
PS03W|Yeah but it gives the impression there's a split group in n it.
PS03X|Well you give the impression of a a faction in the party now I could I could serve this faction quite easily to Mike who'd give me a lot of say if I said you know th the the plot thickens you know here's a town.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03X|hall employee.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03X|always an opponent of the town clerk also now erm trying to cause problems.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03X|I mean that really does make the plot thicken doesn't it.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03X|I mean why was Dave being quoted for what has it got to with Dave He's not an officer of the constitut he isn't a treasurer he isn't secretary he's he's nothing as far the constituency's concerned They if they want any quotes why don't they go and see chairman who's Terry.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03X|I mean this is them deliberately saying things to their friends and deliberately stirring it They oh Because I mean I know where it's coming from some of it's coming from Stanley who who thinks if I don't stand down it will damage Ruth's chances That's not Ruth's own view of it Well it and I don't think with the News of the World round their necks they can afford to start playing silly people Because I'm you know if they sa if they keep crossing me the way they are quite frankly I'm you know willing to make remarks myself Although I don't want to do damaging things but I don't see why I should be the person con cons constantly getting the flack from a group of people who were you know.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03X|Who are genuinely trying to do damage to the party So do you want me to call at the's now.
PS03W|Yeah There's may as well Well don't know Well it doesn't really matter I'll I'll be I mean what so I mean there's except for seeing Anne there's nothing more to do is there.
