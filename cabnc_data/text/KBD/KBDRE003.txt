PS040|Well that's what what I said on Saturday.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|they didn't think they'd be open you know.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|When they come for tea you know.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|on Friday thought they were closed.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|And if you're coming through from Lancaster you know as soon a it's a far old drag in n it After the pubs are closed on the off-chance I mean cos if you get here what the hell do you do if not as if you've got an alternative is there.
PS040|No.
PS03W|You know If yo if you're gon na come here yo you're the ki not on a Saturday night you're not the kind of clientele that's gon na go to the Empire.
