KBDPSUN|What what he's what he's had to say is is is to is to get the ball rolling and get some money and then we can start looking He'll give us that.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|without any security.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|Can have that for starters At a write off of thirty pound a barrel.
PS03W|Oh He's going to write off one as well.
KBDPSUN|This is what he's saying yeah S so you don't get involved or anything this is we can just sign it off All he wants off us we're gon na give him analyses of your last three months' invoices.
PS03W|Right.
KBDPSUN|Right And then wants just some form of a business plan which.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|is probably similar to what your.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah.
KBDPSUN|What you did that on that other thing And then and he'll come and see us sort it all out sort the installation out and erm and and.
KBDPSUN|we've got fifteen left Then we then he says then wha well cos what we're saying is then if your barrelage goes up to four barrels say.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|go back and get another ten to fifteen.
PS03W|Another write off.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|er another write off He says so you you you you you're not you're not stinging yourself up to something er.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|and you take as you improve the business It's whether you know what we've got to look at really is what what basis we can use that fifteen thou for.
PS03W|Mm That's right.
KBDPSUN|As a starter.
PS03W|That's right.
KBDPSUN|You know.
PS03W|The biggest thing is a case of refurbishment to is that that's what we want.
KBDPSUN|That cocktail bar looks alright in the corner over there.

PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|Cos we've missed the March he said because th it's the new financial year so.

PS03W|No Doubt.
KBDPSUN|When it.
PS03W|if it's.
KBDPSUN|when it got to the stage that we only open like one and a half days a week.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|we said well it's not really worth from your company's point of view such an expensive piece of equipment for a I mean was doing the process thing then you know we could utilize the equipment elsewhere But er if you're not really gon na be still like split cups but well.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|it's it's useful for the gas sort of thing.

PS03W|So.
KBDPSUN|do do you know.
PS03W|Oh yeah.
PS03W|Yeah I know that Well when everything's sorted that's it.
KBDPSUN|So you got there's a lot of wasted space in this club.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|Phenomenal amount of wasted space.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|I used to think what.
PS03W|Where does this lead to.
KBDPSUN|This is the back of the the disco.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|Right there was a disco.
KBDPSUN|console on the back.
PS03W|Mm Right.
KBDPSUN|Aye And I got I've got about two hundred of these chairs as well back.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|there which I got off one of my.
PS03W|Here's the piano.
KBDPSUN|That's the piano.
PS03W|And these are.
KBDPSUN|Yeah I mean we have on a couple of occasions always done like fortieths and that on a couple of them We actually set up buffet in there.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|which worked reasonably well.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|I think one did it you know what I mean.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|tart it up and whatever.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|Erm and what else worked well erm for a while we were doing the women's darts And we had about three boards in here and we had a board in there I mean there must be about seven boards in all.
PS03W|Right.
PS03W|Was that a competition was it.
KBDPSUN|No it was a weekly thing Because what they were doing they were going to individual pubs.
PS03W|Oh yeah.
KBDPSUN|Which couldn't cope.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|with it and th wha on their and their cups and everything they.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|wanted them all in one place So.
PS03W|Aha.
KBDPSUN|but erm there was a bit of jealousy in the la licensees started getting a bit er er.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|because we're taking the trade away from them you know they would have obviously had.
PS03W|They were all the other pubs and the darts.
KBDPSUN|Yeah They'd have had a lot.
PS03W|A bit of competition from other place.
KBDPSUN|Well at that stage we were talking to the men's darts secretary came along and was saying he'd be quite interested in in knocking up you know one of the Lancashire matches or something.
PS03W|Oh.
KBDPSUN|like that It's a.
PS03W|Well it's the stage for it int it.
KBDPSUN|Th thing is you can put it on there put it on sta you can er film it and bang it on the big screen over there.
PS03W|Mhm.
KBDPSUN|which is what I I in the I had Eric Bristow and Maureen one night and I mean it was just little dart board in the corner but what I did was I had a big screen like that and I just got student television service just to film it live and just throw it straight back up onto the big.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|onto the thing so you know it was like well it's better than being at the telly I mean it's better.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|than.
PS03W|Watching that.
KBDPSUN|because th on the telly they haven't got those I mean I'm.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|amazed at the on the world championships they've only got those lighting up boards.
PS03W|That's right.
KBDPSUN|haven't they.
PS03W|That's right yeah.
KBDPSUN|You know and I instead of having I mean.
PS03W|Screen up.
KBDPSUN|why they don't just put a screen up.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|that beats me you know They do other sport etcetera See what I mean.
PS03W|Mm Yeah.
KBDPSUN|Well that's part of the course because we need to sort with Johnny's entertainment out with a roof.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|Alright.
KBDPSUN|They've got two or three.
KBDPSUN|little leaks What it is is the ventilation on the roof ventilation shafts when the wind's driven it drives under and leaks through And we get it in two or three places the toilets are are the key one.
PS03W|And you don't see with that.
KBDPSUN|Roof tiles are a fu bloody cost a fortune Yeah so damn I didn't bring the I'll I'll go and I'll go and get the key for that No I'll let you see it may as well while you're here.
KBDPSUN|You can see floor.
PS03W|What's the floor underneath the floor.
KBDPSUN|Concrete.
KBDPSUN|I think what what you mean.
PS03W|What is.
KBDPSUN|the actual car it's just carpet You see it was out in the probably is still out in the hall that one.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|I mean closed now it.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|was open when Colin was there that time of the day.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|You know you'd have ten they say.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|ten if there was only ten people in they'd all be drinking six or seven.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|pints.
KBDPSUN|You haven't got a cold shelf in here But I mean that wouldn't be.
PS03W|No.
KBDPSUN|that's not that difficult to put in here.
PS03W|We'll get them.
KBDPSUN|Yeah Exactly.
PS03W|I think we'll be able to get them to put them in for us.
PS03W|No.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Oh we've got ta pay that one haven't we To pay that one.
PS03W|I think so yeah We've got two coming for ourselves but.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|we'll be able to get them off Gary I think yeah.
PS03W|And we'll be able to say look we want we want how man how many have you got behind there Have you got cold shelves behind there.
KBDPSUN|We've got one two three four behind there.
PS03W|Right So we could get a couple for here.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|couldn't we.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|And you're painting over that I've got ta come and paint.
KBDPSUN|I mean really if if you look fifteen thousand if you could spend fifteen thousand doing all this up.
PS03W|Ah yeah.
KBDPSUN|and you could write off barrels you could still improve your barrel er your barrels a week int it.
PS03W|Oh yeah Yeah.
KBDPSUN|You need er you need to.
PS03W|Definitely.
PS03W|Yeah Oh yeah.
KBDPSUN|And you don't need say you don't need you only need like one private function a week.
PS03W|And promotions you know Malibu promotion night where the.
KBDPSUN|Do promotions that's right Yeah And yo and your er see what I mean about this area up here I mean it's not a bad thingy.
PS03W|No No I mean I don't think.
KBDPSUN|Just time to sit and have a drink and all that.
PS03W|Well.
KBDPSUN|I mean if you wanted you can use the big screen You see cos we put it that position cos er the only dead part of the club is just literally.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|in the corner O the other way you can see the screen from everywhere Erm.
PS03W|I mean how much do you reckon it'll cost If we said ou the carpet we said well a certain area of the carpet wants.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Erm.
KBDPSUN|I mean it's quite a big floor area when you look at it.
PS03W|How much did you say.
PS03W|Yeah probably.
PS03W|in all your nightclubs and what did you say they do a We'll nothing we'll won't be able to paint the floor and put the carpets down on.
KBDPSUN|I mean I.
PS03W|that floor.
KBDPSUN|I would have thought to be honest I would have thought you don't need any of that area.
PS03W|No.
KBDPSUN|carpeted.
PS03W|Just to probably very ends of.
PS03W|Don't you you want your raised area this.
KBDPSUN|You want your two raised areas carpeted.
PS03W|Er by by the bar would you say it no not right in front.
PS03W|you know have that.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|running to about three foot back.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Yeah that.
PS03W|Well.
PS03W|but you don't really want it up to the bar if you're going to get.
PS03W|No I'm saying that.
PS03W|you go right up to the bar.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|you want it up to.
KBDPSUN|See if you put artists on and you have this area as some kind of without carpet on.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|in some ways you haven't put you can actually be you know dancing on this area I mean tha that's the problem we got at the moment.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|On Mary's do what we did I put soul machine over here where the screen was.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|so people could dance on the er on the actual dance floor if they wanted Erm I mean it's not ideal but it really it worked It wor even providing you haven't got a lot of if you've only got about a hundred people it's not too bad that cos it it also creates a bit more atmosphere But it's a better i it's not a bad designed place in a sense that that I mean it's a reasonable size room.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|and you ca and three hundred people er you can take three hundred quite.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|easily I mean you know we've had four fives hundred in.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|You can take three hundred quite easily But the erm the other thing about it is if you have a hundred people in it can be so also be a good atmosphere you know.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|Yet i it's not one of those rooms where if.
PS03W|No.
KBDPSUN|you only get a hu yo you're struggling if you've only a got a hundred.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|Erm what I'm I've just arranged somebody to redo our speaker syste our original system with tannoys we blew our tannoys speakers and I didn't bother getting them replaced because we were going for a rock crowd so we just used Bernie and Nigel.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|P A there.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|What I've got is I've got four of these directional speakers there's two up and two on here and then two big bass ones which sit on a floor back there And so it's very loud on the dance floor but you can actually talk out out here.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|Which I thought we need to redo if we're gon na get private bookings.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|Cos the one thing you always get when you've got a mixture of people I mean all thi this needs recovering basically as well.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|But I mean that's not a big job it's just.
PS03W|No.
KBDPSUN|re relinoing it basically.
PS03W|Oh yeah.
KBDPSUN|Oh yeah.
PS03W|Filling the smoke.
KBDPSUN|Smoke machine.
PS03W|up.
KBDPSUN|Yeah you got a smoke machine we we we would set in little in a hole in the back.
PS03W|And all of these air conditioning valves are on.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|Actually I'm having the a th I mean I can get I'm getting our system back in operation It it was gon na cost me a thousand but I've done a deal with a guy who'd got stuck with some in Manchester so it's gon na cost me five hundred which I'm getting done this Friday Erm to put a satellite system to put a satellite in would be three hundred quid in total.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|So I mean it's that's only one that's only one good'un good night using it in n it a year Pays for that.
PS03W|Yo you're light the er ceiling could you not get away with covering the get the lights a colour blue And er and you know tidying up ceiling obviously.
KBDPSUN|Right.
PS03W|I mean there's lots of bits and pieces you need for a.
PS03W|I mean if you just cover all the areas that were really.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|bad er I reckon I says well what do you think yourself in in in.
KBDPSUN|Well the the big the single biggest cost is is what we do with this a carpet area.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|That's our single biggest cost cos as I say I had three quotes in total and they were all sort of between thirteen and twenty three.
PS03W|Yeah Thousand.
KBDPSUN|Yeah But that's having said that that's to carpet all this area.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|that back area I've just taken you through that the staircase and the corridors out there I mean that's the carpet ev I just said like I wanted a quote to carpet.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|everywhere Erm what we were doing is i what it was for was for for prospective buyers they wanted erm a justification for.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah.
KBDPSUN|the money they were gon na spend I mean they wouldn't have spent that money But they wanted written quotes for a justification more or less.
PS03W|Do you think it's better being like this Looking there or is it better sort of clearing your floor and get a wider dancing space and.
KBDPSUN|Well it's quite it's a reasonable size.
PS03W|I know it's a fair size but.
KBDPSUN|It's a fair size dancing.
PS03W|you know.
KBDPSUN|space actually I mean you get about a hundred people on here it's it's it's alright In fact the in fact it's i at times it's too big That's my one I don't know how you'd ever get over it but that's my one criticism of the thing is that sometimes when you walk in it's the first thing that hits you and unless people are dancing it creates a cold atmosphere.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|Erm.
PS03W|I mean if you've got your group on there's nothing better than having your floor there and are dancing on the floor at at in front of the group kind of thing like.
KBDPSUN|Yeah but I mean a a if you have any.
KBDPSUN|anything like a a a group takes all of this.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|If you have a.
PS03W|That's right.
KBDPSUN|a main group up you know.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|you're struggling to get.
PS03W|But then if you did this floor space like.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|we said.
KBDPSUN|Oh yeah Yeah I mean I I actually don't think you need carpet on I mean I I don't.
PS03W|Oh no.
KBDPSUN|think I don't think you need any of this carpet to be honest.
PS03W|black would that look nice Black carpet.
KBDPSUN|I du n no.
PS03W|Ah cos Peter was saying I du n no I du n no what the black.
PS03W|Don't have to be black you just want you want something that er I don't know really you'd have to think about it wouldn't you.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|Yeah Oh yeah.
KBDPSUN|Could do with probably somebody who knows what they're doing on it.
PS03W|You want the carpet area full of seating.
PS03W|Actually one thing Barry.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|don't you.
KBDPSUN|That's right.
PS03W|Give it a bit of warmth when they're sitting right.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|down the area.
PS03W|That's one thing Ben said though which was quite useful he said get some people down pick their brains.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|You know let them come down and give a quote.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|for whatever you're looking at.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|and pick what they thought was the best thing you could do and then don't don't tell you but get them made.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|You know and like.
PS03W|That's right.
PS03W|I say it these guys are working on this all the time.
KBDPSUN|I mean on a normal night it's the raised areas fill up with people seated.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|This area's er everybody's stood around.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|I mean i i it's a while before these chairs are the they're always the last ones these to sit.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|down cos you're in the middle of the thoroughfare You know i i you need to be full to fill up that area because well you know yourself people like to stand around the bar don't they.
PS03W|Mm Oh That's right yeah.
KBDPSUN|So I mean all you do is get I mean this and this has been down well it's obviously it's been down since it opened now I can't remember when Brewer actually opened.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|but it must be seven years ago If we've been.
PS03W|Nearly seven or eight year ago weren't.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|it.
KBDPSUN|I mean we've been in three.
PS03W|Yeah it'll be about eight eight year ago.
KBDPSUN|It was closed for a.
PS03W|I wonder.
KBDPSUN|year.
PS03W|I wonder how ma had to to town I come down from across the town.
KBDPSUN|I don't know It's getting the steam roller up that worries me.
KBDPSUN|Well you.
PS03W|the time after don't it.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|Well I mean I don't know how to find the other one out.
PS03W|You only have to paint the dance floor on then don't you.
PS03W|I wonder how much it would cost the town like I know it sounds silly but I say the silly things like that are the ones that sometimes are the.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|ones that are took seriously But like you say the floor can stand it and there's nice little corner or whatever int there.
PS03W|I don't know.
PS03W|That was rather a cheekiest thing to do.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|I mean a er a you see ou a good a good looking hard wearing wo lino.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|might not.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|go amiss Cos then you can just just mop it down brush it or whatever you don't even.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|need to bother vacuuming which takes time is a pain in the neck and you can never get a vacuum that's any good anyway And plugs.
PS03W|they might look er you know they look cheapy or.
KBDPSUN|No.
PS03W|sort of.
KBDPSUN|But you.
PS03W|lino being.
KBDPSUN|No they do but you can get good ones now can't you.
PS03W|Ah yeah.
KBDPSUN|I mean you can get ones that look like I just wonder whether you can get ones that look like sort of parquet floors almost.
PS03W|I've seen these industrial companies and he said look have you got any er of your older stuff.
PS03W|What's that Because Polly's got a it was at the front of the bar it's quite a heavy duty thing int it that.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|It'll take fag burns and you want something that's not gon na that's like that's got li like that crystaley stuff.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|in n it And and it's.
KBDPSUN|Yeah that's er that's good That's the stuff.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|you.
PS03W|It's a stuff.
KBDPSUN|want but I would have thought that'll be quite dear won't it You know that kind with all the grit.
PS03W|Yeah I know I like that.
KBDPSUN|in it.
PS03W|I wonder if you went to the industrial companies and said look have you got a a a a big lot of something and.
PS03W|Yeah well that'll be alright.
PS03W|You know.
KBDPSUN|Well do ja er I mean er is it Marnes do that floor covering.
KBDPSUN|Yeah but that was for carpets was it i is is is that do they do the floor coverings there.
PS03W|Yeah Course it's still.
KBDPSUN|Or is it Storeys or.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Yeah they do the floor covering.
KBDPSUN|Find out.
PS03W|Yes I think we'll just work out.
PS03W|I've never been to that have you.
KBDPSUN|That that'll be that and a and a lick of paint.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|and then you're you're half way there Th.
PS03W|Yeah Oh yeah.
PS03W|Yo your main job is to see th.
KBDPSUN|I mean.
PS03W|see the bar open and.
KBDPSUN|th yeah.
KBDPSUN|I mean th the the other thing is we need we need it we need it recovered in something that's but I mean that's not a massive job and we and we and I want the toilet trough that sort of thing.
PS03W|Yeah all that sort of thing What's the ladies like.
KBDPSUN|The ladies are alright Yeah they're alright Don't need I mean if we get somebody in to do that we'd have somebody in do little bits of repairs here and there but generally it's alright I'll show you See there's a tremendous amount of wasted space there.
PS03W|Mm And Jean's corridor.
KBDPSUN|Jean's corridor.
PS03W|I resume see if the places are.
KBDPSUN|It and we had ninety on it on Saturday Bus dri bus driver nearly we nearly hit the the thing nearly keeled over cos he didn't realize how many he'd got upstairs and he went round the bend and it started to go And then cos you're not supposed to stand up upstairs.
PS03W|See the crack int bog.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|I think it's got a bit damaged on Saturday then he put him back.
PS03W|Supposed to lift base But er generally needs.
PS03W|Oh I know.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Aye.
KBDPSUN|The trouble is toilets are toilets and they don't and they.
PS03W|Oh aye.
KBDPSUN|get damaged I mean you just have to keep bloody working on them I.
PS03W|That's nice in the toilet.
PS03W|Yeah take them in.
PS03W|That's right mate.
KBDPSUN|As I say it needs cleaning up of graffiti and a little bit of adjustment and.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|This is the problem er le.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|leaking roof Cos these bloody tiles are expensive.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|They keep getting damaged and collapsing and of course it's part of the fire protection as well so.
PS03W|You've got to be er.
KBDPSUN|Yo they've got you know yo you're not supposed to have damaged ones and we you know for an inspection we have to get th we'd have to oh.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|change all these.
PS03W|Well what about what what who's responsible Is it John is.
KBDPSUN|John is Yeah but I mean you know at the moment we've not been pushing anything till.
PS03W|No.
KBDPSUN|I mean everything's sorted out then I will.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|I think what it probably needs is just a guard round the top ventilation things.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|cos a they're open and the wind drives under it.
PS03W|Well it and shut up to there with and that you can.
KBDPSUN|Ah yeah.

KBDPSUN|That's right.
PS03W|That's right.
PS03W|That's what I mean and we'll be alright.
KBDPSUN|See this is er that goes along here But what I wan na do is trough this and bury these pipes.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|Cos er you just get damage all the time in here And I got Tony coming to do these now.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|Put these under there.
KBDPSUN|Somebody's pulled the sink off.
PS03W|Mind you if you do that your only problem then is your roof int you.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|You just.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|You just put a lick of paint again wo your tiling's awful int it.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|But.
KBDPSUN|I mean.
PS03W|Yeah It's all there.
KBDPSUN|Well if you in you can see the diff I mean you've got what seven urinals there But if you troughed all in an L.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|I mean you'd take could take twenty guys stood there.
PS03W|I mean damage is being done say you have got seven guys there stood what's.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|the other one doing I think can can pull.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|this off.
KBDPSUN|Yeah I know.
PS03W|So they've nothing better to do You got them on trough then they're saying alright we'll do it somewhere else.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Then the longer you got them in here they're likely.
KBDPSUN|That's right.
PS03W|to.
KBDPSUN|That's right There's enough here for a trough.
PS03W|Oh aye.
KBDPSUN|Well I du n no it's go it's got I was showing th I was showing the licensing people round erm the inspection of Jean we Jean wasn't here we were looking round and fire brigade and that were there and inspection we turned round and all written across is Jean is a fucking fat cow Alright.
KBDPSUN|I mean I mean you tried not to laugh.
KBDPSUN|we tried desperately to avoid looking at her right.
KBDPSUN|And the environmental health guy there and all.
PS03W|Well they probably thought you wrote it.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Looks like they're not getting on.
KBDPSUN|This was a good idea of Johnny's which they did which did before was this corridor these lights up here that one when it's but there's one two three four five six and they framed a large advertising poster.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|And so like hundred quid a year.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|for.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|For putting it.
PS03W|It could be a.
PS03W|out.
KBDPSUN|I mean it's six hundred quid for doing nothing in n it.
PS03W|That's right.
PS03W|Six is it Oh.
KBDPSUN|Erm you know er I can't remember who they are but it wasn't clientele but I mean we could you know we could.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|look around for the relevant er.
PS03W|That's right.
PS03W|And how much of this stuff's down I mean this'll have been down I oh won't be able to get as much wear.
KBDPSUN|Yeah This is this is this is.
KBDPSUN|original as far as I know.
PS03W|Did you lay that yourself.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|A little bit.
PS03W|Do they just seem to stick on tap or is it a row.
KBDPSUN|No no no this is a row.
PS03W|A row Yeah.
PS03W|The stuff that's that's the stuff you want.
PS03W|This is it is not the similar stuff like we've got in the kitchen upstairs.
PS03W|No.
PS03W|No.
KBDPSUN|That rug stuff.
PS03W|It is er it's er.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|a actually it is like that stuff But it's different.
PS03W|It wasn't here was it Same.
PS03W|No.
PS03W|sort of thing.
PS03W|No.
PS03W|Maybe that's the type of thing you want on the floor.
PS03W|I reckon that is That is it.
KBDPSUN|In there Make do some more er extend the er er er er parquet flooring area to give you more dance room An and and round the other areas which.
PS03W|Up here.
KBDPSUN|and keep the carpet on the high seating areas.
PS03W|Oh aye Yeah I think it's better up there.
KBDPSUN|Oh yeah Aye but it wouldn't cost very much to carpet those two areas.
PS03W|No.
KBDPSUN|I think you do you know do something.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|a little bit better but I mean.
KBDPSUN|but it you just need something that's ro that's hardwearing and.
PS03W|And practical really isn't it.
KBDPSUN|you know.
PS03W|As I say people aren't going in in there to look at oh what a pretty carpet you've got.
KBDPSUN|No.
PS03W|Oh no.
PS03W|As long as it's as long as it it's warm.
KBDPSUN|Well if you remember most of the time the lights are off.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|It's only to create an impression when you're doing it in the day time.
PS03W|Yeah That's right.
KBDPSUN|I mean I don't know whether you've thought any more about that idea that Colin had but I mean I don't know yo cos you haven't said you do you haven't really looked round it.
PS03W|No that's right you know the the the only thing we've we've actually gon na trying to get that into a the bar is er segregate.
KBDPSUN|Perhaps er Jean's left actually.
KBDPSUN|This is this was the the cloakroom and what we were what we were intending doing originally.
KBDPSUN|is turn it into an office.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|I mean we haven't done so far but we that's what but this is stuff we got about hundred.
PS03W|Oh yeah.
KBDPSUN|and fifty quid for two massive rolls like this.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|Well that's well that's what not ba bad is it for those int.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|it.
KBDPSUN|Yeah I mean that's what Jean's talking about getting.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|That's alright int it.
PS03W|Oh to but that will fit is a bit.
KBDPSUN|Well er.
PS03W|bit more thickness than I hoped er but if it's sat on top of there and on top of what's on.
KBDPSUN|On top of what's on Right.
PS03W|I don't know whether they were actually sitting right where the bevel or whatever I know this sort of stuff is we had similar to when I worked in the shop er used to he had three quarters of this guy come round in a van or whatever back of a van.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|and he laid it himself.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|and by the entrance and whatever er.
PS03W|I think you'd have to get a professional carpet.
PS03W|So.
PS03W|layer just just to make certain.
PS03W|Summat like that really is is obviously.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|And it's just stuck on int it.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|I mean i er I I spent as I say.
KBDPSUN|spent the best part of the year working in here sort of nine to five type thing and it's mind walking down that bottom end without any ar without any natural light.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|That little office you know so I said to Jean you know well let's turn this into an office.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|basically Erm.
PS03W|No I can did you have a cloakroom then Or did you.
KBDPSUN|No I mean we u when we when we use whe the the rave used this as a cloakroom Erm but I mean there are there are other areas you can use.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|And you can use you could use past that erm cos that's the other thing I haven't shown you is is this is all ours as well down the bottom end Erm and that's the other thing about having having sort of a lot of people thinking it having having it as a sort of rock club at night they they regard it as their own sort of thing.
PS03W|Oh right.
KBDPSUN|I mean so when we do have to do redecoration we just got ta let the volunteers in.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|Left a a crate of Pils for them and carry on painting everything Right this is er that's the snooker next door.

PS03W|Yeah I know but it's it's it's summat.
PS03W|Aye.
KBDPSUN|Right So that's round it.
PS03W|So the easiest thing really is obviously is if I get the thing sorted out and then turn it.
KBDPSUN|Yep.
PS03W|around and er we've had a word with Elliel this morning.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Erm they they're quite happy with with all that sort of stuff.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|They're gon na come up are you free on Fri Thursday afternoon at fouro'clock.
KBDPSUN|Thursday's a busy day for us really Fiveo'clock 's fine but fouro'clock 's probably.
PS03W|But I th th they're actually supposed to get Friday rush.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|and then you really should with the staff we've.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|got So.
KBDPSUN|Er.
PS03W|cos unless we're going to get it straight but it just all comes in like this time of year and just comes and let us in I mean.
KBDPSUN|What so so ba as la as towards fiveo'clock as as possible.
PS03W|If we got here if we got if we got to fa wherever you wanted to meet where do you want to meet.
KBDPSUN|Well I'd rather I'd.
PS03W|Come down to us.
KBDPSUN|I'd rather ma come down to you to be honest.
PS03W|Well if you come down to us so.
KBDPSUN|Cos then Mike ought to see your operation as.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|well you see so.
PS03W|If you bring him down about.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|you know half four to five.
KBDPSUN|Half four.
PS03W|we'll be.
PS03W|You'll get the idea.
PS03W|we'll be getting on top.
KBDPSUN|Alright.
PS03W|then you know.
KBDPSUN|Okay.
PS03W|We're usually done by five you know so there's.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|no problem.
PS03W|Make by five.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|o'clock.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Fiveo'clock.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|I think the biggest thing really is just like they say is how much you can get that done for and get the roofing done that's got ta be done.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Er.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|some paper them toilets cos er I'm you know I say from our our both side is something that's er I mean everybody's looking purely from and return sales All you're looking at is for an income an income from it and er I reckon can do very well.
PS03W|What do you what you think of that bar area Barry Do you think it could be inclined to be.
PS03W|Er the top one.
PS03W|as a drinking area.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|U yeah I mean I.
PS03W|during the day.
PS03W|yeah well it was it was what I wanted to it was what I wanted to it was wanted to do initially I mean but then you have like so many ideas that.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|you know you can't do them all in that sense but if you had somebody somebody like Colin might be able to.
KBDPSUN|Cos you only need you only need him to drag sort of fifteen twenty people in initially.
PS03W|And five ten of them.
PS03W|And they'll all they'll all be drinkers.
KBDPSUN|Yeah But I mean sa ta so there's an at little atmosphere there anyway.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|erm and then you can I mean well it gives you the opportunity to you know bang in a bloody jazz band or whatever you wan na do in there somewhere.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|and and build it up like that.
PS03W|As you said they haven't actually you know it'd be if you could get some sort of portable.
KBDPSUN|Screening.
PS03W|screen that'd just shut it off.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|So people don't feel as though they're sat in a wide ai wide open.
KBDPSUN|No I know yeah Yeah that's right.
PS03W|you know Erm.
KBDPSUN|Well you ca you ca you can get that.
PS03W|You can get you can do something.
KBDPSUN|But yeah.
PS03W|can't you.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Like you say if you get your satellite T V in there.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|you know you can.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|just make it a cosy little bar where you can.
KBDPSUN|Yeah That's right.
PS03W|It won't cost any to give it a go would it.
PS03W|No If Colin's if Colin's up for it it wouldn't at all I mean it needs to perhaps perhaps they can do something for the first couple.
PS03W|Oh yeah need some sort of er.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|idea to get it going and get it off the ground even if you you put your beer on at well I just thought of couple Boddingtons put their they're they're gon na put their they're gon na put there's at a pound a pint.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|You know just to attract some people you know approach the brewery say look what about a few keg And if you get two or three keg put that money into free stock you know.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|Say you.
KBDPSUN|Cleaner's not the cleaner's not done behind here yet.
PS03W|If you open it up if you do get it open and advertise it at Boddingtons a pound a pint get them straight to come in You're not making a fortune at first but once you get it going.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|You said about traditional.
PS03W|The only other thing is the.
PS03W|Depends where your money is really.
PS03W|Whe whe where's your cellar.
KBDPSUN|Right underneath Right at the bottom.
PS03W|Yeah but if if you.
PS03W|How big's your fire exit entrance.
PS03W|the fire exit.
PS03W|You could put it behind you could feed it through the wall behind to where that.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|spacious room is where all your chairs are couldn't you.
KBDPSUN|Yeah We probably could yeah Th well it's no it's not quite the back.
PS03W|how would you get in there.
KBDPSUN|Yeah that's the that's the thing I was.
PS03W|Well it's got it's a bit dry this.
KBDPSUN|I know It's a bloody yeah.
PS03W|You can still.
KBDPSUN|It's fucking ridiculous.
PS03W|Erm cos you'd tell the brewery wouldn't you.
PS03W|The only other thing to do is is do what er er we did at one time and just get a bright beer and open it up and er and then pull it And have it.
PS03W|I know.
PS03W|Now there's a thought.
KBDPSUN|It er you'd have problem with er.
PS03W|But would you.
KBDPSUN|Depends tha I don't know what sort of draw you can put on that pump here They're getting smart.
PS03W|But I wan na do what the Three Miners do in Lancaster don't they.
PS03W|That's that er that's a traditional beer in n it.
KBDPSUN|Yeah That's right yeah.
PS03W|they got ta but he's knocking it straight.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|down aren't they.
PS03W|It's just getting it up here.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah Yeah very strong lad this.
PS03W|You might have to do it later.
KBDPSUN|Can I look at the telly.
PS03W|Yeah course you can I was gon na.
PS03W|It's in here.
PS03W|suggest that.
PS03W|Up here and then get.
PS03W|Oh oh that's my order for Thursday.
KBDPSUN|Oh right.
PS03W|Have you got line cleaner Yeah.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|That's put a.
KBDPSUN|A fair int it doing.
PS03W|The bar the bar on the bar.
PS03W|The bar's there I mean I was thinking you had your stool painted that white on.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|or a red a deep.
PS03W|Oh yeah.
PS03W|sort of red behind the bar maybe get a couple more like that.
KBDPSUN|Yeah a lick of paint and and.
PS03W|Oh yeah.
KBDPSUN|and and that you know and you can.
PS03W|And then we'll fill the shelves up.
PS03W|That's right.
KBDPSUN|All all one thing we haven't discussed is is these ar these arrears int it that we've got This the rates.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|is the biggest one int it.
PS03W|Right Right.
KBDPSUN|Now I don't know if it's worth asking.
PS03W|Well I could.
KBDPSUN|council to if you could like lump it with the next year's.
PS03W|El e Elliel Elliel said that er they could probably twist the council's arm.
PS03W|What's that for Barry.
KBDPSUN|Well this you know we're on about this money.
PS03W|Yes.
KBDPSUN|well there is there is ba bad debts you know which er.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|I don't know if I've got them here.
PS03W|How much is that for.
KBDPSUN|Well it was er it was about.
PS03W|Twenty two.
KBDPSUN|here we are that's it er it's rent which we we're gon na clear.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|there's twelve for rates and the twelve and other two's ours which we're we.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|can we can stand on that.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|You've got you've got like water rate twelve hundred er rates twelve but er what we could try to do is approach them and see if we can lump it in with this year and that obviously have to pay higher.
PS03W|I mean some of it is is the next two month anyway erm.
KBDPSUN|Yeah But we we'd usually have no.
PS03W|but.
KBDPSUN|rents er we've no er we've lease to pay back have we or owt like that.
PS03W|Oh and the other the other thing is is is by asking Fred for.
PS03W|To pay.
PS03W|That's right.
KBDPSUN|But even so then ask Fred on the long term would be ideal Er the biggest thing is for us is is making payable for you.
PS03W|Yeah I mean.
KBDPSUN|At first.
PS03W|we've not gone any further with this Fre with Fred because.
PS03W|No.
PS03W|we're just leaving it so we sort ourselves out first on on how.
PS03W|Yes.
PS03W|we feel happy with it and.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|and whe how how whether you want Fred involved in in what way.
KBDPSUN|Well it's really that's needed be here you know if we ca.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|if we can.
PS03W|And.
KBDPSUN|if we can resolve it with cos then you're getting summat on a different style of thinking to that you know I know Fred doesn't wan na be involved but then you've always got somebody well we'll have to go and see Fred first.
PS03W|Mm.
KBDPSUN|And and I don't know.
PS03W|Yeah you could work it.
KBDPSUN|Go see Fred and he's probably got a few more pounds ready available than.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|than we have.
PS03W|Oh yeah.
KBDPSUN|You know that's the er.
PS03W|That's right.
KBDPSUN|bit difficult.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|And that's your er cos er personally.
PS03W|Oh I've got the.
KBDPSUN|I'll say that it's not.
PS03W|accounts in various islands and and.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|black bin liners in his back garden.
KBDPSUN|If we can sort him out with rates and I don't know.
PS03W|If he can o if we can offset if we can use all if he'll out time type of thing.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|with that.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|erm the oh er.
KBDPSUN|You've got ta put an offer in and pay it so much a month haven't you or something and and and get it paid off over a period of time.
PS03W|And then you can do it without Fred and really with Fred is is at the end of day you could pro proof pay load could go back to yourself and I I E and ourselves but by having him that other cut you're gon na be saying well it's all a bit more than your share I mean from my point of view I don't think he's ever.
PS03W|I don't think Fred'd be looking for anything as a return.
KBDPSUN|No.
PS03W|Not in the shor.
PS03W|I'd be quite happy to come.
PS03W|not in the short term Not in the short term.
PS03W|you get tucked into it and obviously there we'll keep it sort of low profile But giving it a good clean out and getting.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|it dus painted behind the things whatever come on Sunday or whatever and just say that you might.
PS03W|In return yeah Just take a.
PS03W|quite keen just to sort of get.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|mucked into it.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|just to save money.
KBDPSUN|See if you can get.
PS03W|but as long as I say the biggest thing from my point er is not to so lose money if you can do from where we're going.
PS03W|No.
PS03W|And use the fifteen grand to its best image in the way that you feel then you can turn round and run a club so it can get people in.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|And we can get the lighting in Because that's what your best thing is.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|you've got the ideas and th the motions.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|And for yourself and what we don't wan na do is like I say is spend money that is just gon na disappear and say shit We haven't really improved the pub's barrelage if goes away.
PS03W|No I mean th the other aspect of the of the fif the other aspect of the the brewery and me that I was talking about er I'm thinking about is that we we could do with you know okay those th those figures are I mean unless they're really realistic it's gon na be you know six months or so.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|before we start getting up to the kind of figures where we can actually see a you know.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|a profit each week.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|a a a reasonably substantial profit I mean.
KBDPSUN|That's right yeah.
PS03W|so with the best will in the world it's going to be six months so let's so we need a little of breathing space.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|on that six months Now er er obviously if if we can if we can get the money off the brewery cos you know if we can get a little bit more.
PS03W|That's right yes.
PS03W|than we actually need to spend that that.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|enables us to you know have that breathing space erm so we can start.
PS03W|Well what what we can you know I say he's offering us this fifteen unsecured if we can mind you.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|I don't know if we can squeeze any more or what.
KBDPSUN|I reckon.
PS03W|but but you know if say well look you know we could do with twenty five and he turns round and he might say well you know yo he might say no.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|but we know we've got fifteen just to get us.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|going.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah Yeah.
PS03W|What he said then is look you know hey he's all you're saying really.
PS03W|is ah if your barrelage is there then what we do is buy five or six barrels from Morecambe Bay Wines.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|You can soon get rid of those.
PS03W|You can say Morecambe Bay Wines and buy all his.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|cos what I I just said to him I said look I says a er sometimes I says it's an awkward time drop for us Says well we'll get it delivered here you know only without.
PS03W|Yeah well that's.
PS03W|invoice.
PS03W|That's what we wanted in n it.
PS03W|Well what we do what we use.
KBDPSUN|What we do is buy it barrelled and and.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|get out be.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|Morecambe Bay License form.
PS03W|Barrel or keg.
KBDPSUN|Because we ca we can live on thirty pound on barrel can't we I think we can do.
PS03W|I'd like you to just purely myself I'm not saying I'm right and you're not right and people like.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|my o my own personal view is if we just pay the fifteen and it's sort of off in there straight away and then spend but not to sort of say well you can spend it and update it can't you But spend what we feel is gon na make the club.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|better image like you say.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|somebody comes to look at it just for a view I mean I say I I'm quite happy coming like I said th if you motion behind there make the bar presentable we'll fill it out with stock then that'll look better.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|but if we do display.
KBDPSUN|Put more stock in.
PS03W|we've got a load.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|of tent cards and display things.
PS03W|Yeah.

PS03W|You know and we'll do it ourselves I say I mean what you want Barry is like wan na keep it low profile.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|But we've both got time to sort I say somebody we'd enjoy doing it Because we we we either do it ourselves and spend.

PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|they're all all they are are they're pho photographic you know when you have blackouts and er you know the.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|they're that kind of mat.
KBDPSUN|Yeah I know what you mean.
PS03W|white material they're just white but they they a total black out which they use on the rave nights I mean I do I think the view is quite nice certainly if you got a summer it's.
KBDPSUN|Oh well yeah.
PS03W|quite a pleasant evening See my idea originally was that cos it comes back from when I used to go in the in the Blue Anchor in Lancaster after work I mean we had everybody in there We had like market traders in there managers of Marks and Spencers and Woolies.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|and you know building societies insurance companies and everybody's i the rounds were like twenty five quid a time but everybody's only drinking halves cos you could never.
KBDPSUN|That's right.
PS03W|you know so just half a gui but it it got that but once they changed the opening hours do you remember when they brought in six.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|o'clock.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|It destroyed all that.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|And then er they brought it back and then they started doing to quarter to six but it still wasn't good enough cos you can't you can't have all these people in suits and briefcases stood outside a pub for quarter of an hour waiting for it open you know.
KBDPSUN|No.
PS03W|I mean it wasn't good.
KBDPSUN|That's right.
PS03W|for their image.
KBDPSUN|No no.
PS03W|So.
KBDPSUN|Suit off Oh no they're your.
PS03W|So it like killed that But I'm sure there's I'm sure there's that kind of trade for you know a sort of a Bic Biro runner type you know that kind of well our age group you know.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|the sort of.
KBDPSUN|Well that's it yeah.
PS03W|thirty to thirty to.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|fifty age group.
KBDPSUN|That's right.
PS03W|And and people want a drink after work and have a chat cos the.
KBDPSUN|Yeah.
PS03W|it was a it was all business people and you're talking about.
KBDPSUN|That's right.
PS03W|you know what it was like what things were and.
KBDPSUN|Once you can get people in you know you got ta attract them in but once you get them in they'll.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|be ev oh it's alright.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|I quite like it.
PS03W|Got them into this place.

KBDPSUN|That's right.

PS03W|Elliel's our discount because you know they're doing.
KBDPSUN|No.
PS03W|It was great.
KBDPSUN|Mm.
PS03W|I mean the biggest thing really I think my interest in all this to get secure trade from us.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03W|which we're gon na get and get your salary You know because they're the few main things round here you're happy and you can feel that obviously you you'll be working for something.
PS03W|Yeah I mean to be honest I've put in like two two years without any.
KBDPSUN|Oh I know Yeah I know.
PS03W|salary with this place I mean I've been doing outside jobs to get you know I mean like doing festivals.
PS03W|and whatever else to get.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|my money in So the.
PS03W|Has an anybody come to you through the.
PS03W|and you're losing money if you're not if you're not seeing any return you're.
KBDPSUN|No.
PS03W|you're going through the motions.
KBDPSUN|No.
PS03W|I mean God you know if I've got ta go down to London for three days I'd rather do that cos it's gon na earn me two or three grand.
PS03W|Well we could set like you say and no you know and get it going and you make a salary.
KBDPSUN|and and then if there's anything left e er between us and then that's all well.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|and good.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|We're we're not wanting a wage out of it or anything you know.
PS03W|We'll get it to the.
PS03W|Well you'll get it you'll get it from the turnover won't you.
KBDPSUN|We we're we're quite we're quite pleased you know say well let's see if we can get it going and and make a success out of it.
PS03W|And also I mean if we turn over hundred thousand pound with you in a year you're gon na make some money out of that.
PS03W|That's right Yeah You know so it's.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|er.
PS03W|Make a grand or summat out of that won't you.
KBDPSUN|That's it yeah.
KBDPSUN|If we're lucky.
PS03W|If you're lucky.
KBDPSUN|The only th the only thing is is th is what we'll do the beer whether we're gon na have to connect it to the brewery or whether we can get it through ourselves I don't know I would think you're probably gon na have committed to separate accounts.
PS03W|Yeah I'm not too bothered about that.
KBDPSUN|But as I said.
PS03W|But if it's if it can be dropped at your place.
KBDPSUN|Well that's it yeah.
PS03W|Because I mean er you can always say look I've got commitments all over the place and actually be.
KBDPSUN|Well I've tol I I sold them that.
PS03W|Yeah.
KBDPSUN|I says I says he's go he can't lose his.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|with you you've got ta get the rest of the stuff.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah.
KBDPSUN|As long as.
PS03W|See.
KBDPSUN|we can.
PS03W|Well that.
KBDPSUN|it doesn't it doesn't matter what barrelage you put through it but put as long as we know that er the fifteen thou it's gon na be written off at thirty pound a barrel so the sooner you you do it the sooner it's written off.
PS03W|Yeah But also.
PS03W|Good.
PS03W|it also means we haven't got any that's an area where we haven't got any repayments.
