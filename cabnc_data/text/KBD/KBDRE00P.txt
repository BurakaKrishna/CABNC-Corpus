PS03Y|I've seen it seen that one I've seen that match they were lucky.
PS03W|Sunderland won who were they playing.
PS03Y|Sunderland won Er Oxford I think They were winning three nil three two at the end of it Oxford scored one on the end.
PS03W|Not many first division teams left is there.

PS03Y|Wrexham were unlucky against Blackburn.
PS03W|Oh Weren't they Didn't they play well.
PS03Y|Yes They've always been a.
PS03W|I thought they played.
PS03Y|good club side Wrexham.
PS03W|Yeah they have but I mean they got a lot of good skilful young lads haven't they They're only like nineteen and twenty.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|and I mean that young fullback looked brilliant That lef.
PS03Y|Yeah Mm mm Quite good Composed as well like Talented.
PS03W|Yeah It's a funny law that er clear chance at goal job in n it I mean it's a funny definition I must admit I I if you could stop that deliberate foul it's I mean it's better for the game if you can stop it.
PS03Y|Send them off.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah That's right I mean if you're gon na do it.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|do it do it do it.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|consistently Cos actually the other thing about defenders hauling people down like that you know how many times when a forward's through one on one on a goal keeper does he score It's not that often actually.
PS03Y|No.
PS03W|I mean okay somebody like Besty.
PS03Y|Thing you want.
PS03W|you could bet on.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|nine times out of ten but.
PS03Y|But even even against the goalkeeper they fucking lose fifty percent of the like.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03Y|I was saying more than fifty percent of the playing.
PS03W|Yeah I would yeah Yeah Yeah.
PS03Y|And that's all just one on one on the goalkeeper.
PS03W|Yeah Well that's what I mean I mean you know th th the player could let him could let him go really without deliberately fouling him because it's it's gon na.
PS03Y|Half the.
PS03W|be at least a fifty fifty.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|chance that the goalkeeper's gon na save it in n it.
PS03Y|It's fucking got ta be straight like that I I I don't fucking taking off three points for a At the start it seemed to improve the matches but it they've just become too hectic now I think.
PS03W|Mm.
PS03Y|You know there's not as much skill involved as there was.
PS03W|No No that's right It's.
PS03Y|Like the.
PS03W|incredibly passed.
PS03Y|the first the first season like the football did seem to improve but it's not.
PS03W|That's right.
PS03Y|gon na go back now I think.
PS03W|United have got a strange side at the moment though.
PS03Y|Oh yes.
PS03W|I mean I don't think you can it's alright having all these players but if you he doesn't seem.
PS03Y|They don't play.
PS03W|he doesn't seem to.
PS03Y|They.
PS03W|have an idea of what he wants Cos I mean.

PS03W|every week he's got a different sort of format.
PS03Y|Well what's he supposed to do Giggs Semen.
PS03W|Well he had him.
PS03Y|Well I think he's got ta look at and the team should be in with you.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03Y|like.
PS03W|He had him playing yesterday er but they dropped Hughes.
PS03Y|Yeah I know Well you don't drop Hughes for anybody.
PS03W|And his two subs Hughes and Sharp I mean it does rather hamstring.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|you if anything happens to a central defender dun n it.
PS03Y|Yeah Well I don't think Hughes should ever be sub like he should be on the team.
PS03W|Well that's right even if he's not scoring goals he's creating so much pressure and and.
PS03Y|Yeah he always done like Good in defence as well.
PS03W|Yeah That's right Well he's also summat er I mean he's he's one of the best at holding a ball you know.
PS03Y|Fantastic shielding the ball.
PS03W|on his own.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|Yeah.

PS03W|it was a it was full pass inside to two fullbacks er for the Southampton player that was running on this fullback shaded it away you know guiding him out of it he's running to the e sa Smeichel came out to the edge of the area but he was like right on the edge as the player was coming to him so he just let it roll a little bit further he stopped it with his foot the guy came and tackled him off got it instead of just picking it up with his hand I mean he was actually in the area but like he was right on the edge and he took a step back.
PS03Y|Why the fuck didn't he.
PS03W|and stopped it with his foot Yeah.
PS03Y|wait for the ball coming in I tell you Liverpool were really lucky cos er Bristol Rovers had got a penalty.
