PS03Y|What about all these Barry.
PS03W|No we'll keep those for su you never know.
PS03Y|Yeah okay Put them in here.
PS03W|So we have and erm we're gon na open up the top bar top bar and ripping up the carpet.
PS03W|in the main room and lino in the main floor right in in sort of.
PS03Y|Which one.
PS03W|probably blue.
PS03Y|The one.
PS03W|Yeah And redoing the stage floor And I'm carpeting I think I'll carpet tile.
PS03Y|Have you had a price on what it's gon na cost to put that down.
PS03W|Not that much cos we're getting the lino off Pete you see and get the discount off to do the just for the lino.
PS03Y|Oh right Yeah course.
PS03W|and then make it.
PS03Y|Rhona's husband.
PS03W|Yeah yeah Erm and having a carpet tile because we can then do it red white and not white but red and blue you know.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|And if you.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|damage a tile then you're only replacing a tile And just sort of carpet the two top areas two raised areas and have the other the rest of it as a sort of lino floor.
PS03Y|Mm.
PS03W|So then then it allows to dance as well and basically hardly anybody sits in that area until the club's full anyway.
PS03Y|Mm mm.
PS03W|so that they all go in the Erm going to somehow at the moment we're thinking of well Jean'll wan na do it but I'm I'm thinking of doing some kind of I mean we're agreed on what we're gon na do but it's how we do it I want some ka er some kind of grilling around the top the cocktail bar area so you can open it as a as a bar and it'll have a sort of atmosphere in itself so we open that as a pub type of thing you know.
PS03Y|Oh right Yeah yeah yeah.
PS03W|Leave the big screen on and that and we can put erm and get you know as I say if you.
PS03Y|Do you.
PS03W|you get see if we can get hold of like I mean you won't be able to get hold of a Wurlitzer because nowadays they're like gold dust but you might be able to get hold of parts you see If you could just get hold of say the rainbow.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|effect of a Wurli I mean that's the beauty about it you you'll never get hold of a Harley Davidson but you might get hold of a petrol cap.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|You know or things.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|like that you know.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|and you just bang those around the place Er a few handlebars and whatever else and but but but don't do it like the British bikers do it like an American bar so it can be cleaned and.
PS03W|I mean it can look nice and.
PS03Y|Yeah.
PS03W|sparkling and fiftiesey and lots of pictures and.
PS03Y|Not the dirty bloody smell and greasy.
PS03W|No that's right yeah That's right You see and then if if if if if sort of people are you know holiday makers come in and it's an American theme they expect it.
PS03Y|Mm.
PS03W|As I say they expect I've got music it's not gon na come as a shock to them.
PS03Y|They've got.
PS03W|You know and it'll and it'll have a sort of atmosphere I think And and it won't cost a lot to do cos all you do instead of green you'll paint that red and you've got the white pick out anyway and a blue seated blue carpet.
PS03Y|I wondered what those fucking.
PS03Y|No where am I gon na be able to get rid of this.
PS03W|I don't know.
PS03W|I think we'll have to I think we've got to keep it cos I think it's part of the fixtures and fittings unfortunately.
PS03W|And I'm gon na do er you know lots of promotions and stuff promotions on that.
PS03Y|And then your promotions yeah.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah We well what I think I'm gon na do is next Thur not this Thursday we'll just have to live through this Thursday but next Thursday erm I'm gon na get get Stella back on and I'm just gon na sell it as cost whatever it is sixty P a pint or whatever.
PS03W|Yeah I mean cos at the end of the day if you've got the if you've got if you can get er sixty people.
PS03Y|You'll.
PS03W|two fifty to come in I don't mind if I'm giving the booze away And er as long you got the.
PS03Y|As long as you're not losing on it Yeah.
PS03W|Well it doesn't matter does it You know cos that's the only way we're gon na build Thursdays up No.
PS03Y|That'll be gone then.
PS03W|Je Jean's is it Right Get rid of it.
