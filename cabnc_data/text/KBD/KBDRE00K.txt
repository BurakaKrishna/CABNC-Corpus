PS03W|See this was this was the dance floor before.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|er where it follows this line.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|And it was a sort of funny shaped thing Yeah Just to here And it was like nothing so we just extended all this out and made it into a stage come a bigger dance floor cos the I don't know why they wa always seem to have this trends that they have these trends in the seventies and that was and eighties of having small dance floors.
PS040|Right tiny dance floors yeah.
PS03W|Right that's and the disco console was open to the public so the public could just wander in and tap the D J on the back and tu change his records for him or whatever It's a stupid opera so we've fenced that in Erm but this is the area up here Anne that I was sort of thinking that we could if we can some kind of trellis or something around this raised area here you could actually open this bit as the as a pub on a.
PS040|With what Sorry.
PS03W|as a sort of pub you know on a Saturday and Sunday in the season Food and that You know and with a big screen you can have like sport or Grandstand or.
PS040|Right.
PS03W|ro music videos or whatever you wan na do Get satellite in and get M T V on Mind you the satellite's gon na cost three hundred quid Roughly.
PS040|This is like cocktail bar bit.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|isn't it.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS03W|I mean change all the paint o pa paint all the change all the green to sort of red.
PS040|Green shouldn't be up anyway.
PS03W|Yeah Red and then you got the white pick out.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|and you got the blue seats so you've got red white and blue haven't you.
PS040|Yeah They aren't cheap chairs these either.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|are they.
PS03W|Oh no Nothing was cheap I mean.
PS040|No I wouldn't have thought it was.
PS03W|the seats are good you know these tables are bloody heavy And they've done a you know they did a good job when they built it Erm I mean you can see what he what he intended doing was the plans were beautiful This was gon na be there's a piano there on that.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|raised area there so this was like a piano bar.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|there was gon na be a big fountain in the middle there.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|this wasn't gon na be disco.
PS040|No.
PS03W|a big fountain in the middle there.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|and an orange grow.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|type affect it was gon na be called the ora this was the blue one so that was the orange.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|purple whatever The bar was a open.
PS040|Bar across that other side.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Great.
PS03W|And the other side.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|which was gon na be a big glassed disco.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|in there and that was gon na be the disco and this was the you know I mean it was a good idea I don't know why he pulled out with went Erm you know.
PS040|True.
PS03W|These are the things we were talking about yesterday these uprights I mean they just.
PS040|Erm.
PS03W|open for.
PS040|well you could shorten them anyway.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|You could just shorten them And.
PS03W|I mean they're very sort of vandal easy or whatever Vandal a fa er vandal friendly hooligan friendly aren't they.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|Whatever You know I mean we just got them cheap erm lampshades from now on er cos it's not worth it cos th the expensive ones are just getting damaged all the time.
PS040|We could shorten them anyway and just put lamps on them.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Whatever If you don't hang them on Gerry's thingy anyway.
PS03W|No you don't That's right See if you sort of somehow trellis that area that side in you could actually have this mo more intimate if people just wanted to.
PS040|Snog.
PS03W|sit in here Yeah Yeah If you got you know if you got a character behind the bar could er attract people by his own force of personality.
PS040|I think erm you could but you know really then you think when.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|they come in we can start.
PS03W|Oh yeah Yeah Yeah it is Cos I wouldn't lo I mean I actually don't think you can do if you're gon na do people are gon na eat I th I think you're gon na be pushed at more than about hundred and fifty to two hundred You know depends on how you retail it first but.
PS040|I think it depends which it what you.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|do.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Erm.
PS03W|I mean it depends a as you say er yeah I mean it does depend that Cos if if you if you if you wanted to you could always utilize all the dance floor area tables and things you know If you had that kind of function that you you know.
PS040|Mm Makes it difficult to do a big functions though in here with that stage.
PS03W|Oh yeah.
PS040|You know to set out.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|you co there's no way.
PS03W|Yeah it does.
PS040|you can set out for two hundred.
PS03W|No No What we did do.
PS040|And so.
PS03W|very well.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|erm we were we some of the jazz stuff I mean.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|it it it never worked in a sense that it wasn't commercially viable.
PS040|No.
PS03W|but things like Kenny Ball and that we'd had.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|and we had like the ta trestle tables in all these alcoves and people came and actually booked a meal.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|and and you had a meal and sat and watched the band and everything It wor i I mean for those it did work.
PS040|Different sort of like.
PS03W|it did work.
PS040|Yeah Just.
PS03W|But.
PS040|need the.
PS03W|you can see everywhere And it did.
PS040|Put hot food.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|up at the back as well there.
PS03W|Mm Have you actually ever seen round this place properly.
PS040|Not properly No I haven't really Whe whe where do you get to that round round.
PS03W|No.
PS040|part.
PS03W|No you can't that's one of the do you wan na sta I'll just go and get the key so you can have a.
PS040|Yeah go on.
PS03W|quick look in there.
PS040|I'll go up there.
PS03W|Get your bearings.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|It actually looks bigger looking that way than it does when you're up there looking back I think Erm I'm thinking of atmosphere But if we if we carpet the two raised areas in a sort of attract hardwearing linoey type affect on there cos you can.
PS040|What about the slipping.
PS03W|you can dance Well you get.
PS040|The carpet don't it really up here.
PS03W|No Well i it's been down since it opened so that's.
PS040|Oh.
PS03W|got ta be eight or nine years.
PS040|Mm It's done well then.
PS03W|It's done well.
PS040|It was on.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|concrete.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|like Oh right So this is just this is just virtually there you can't get through that way anywhere.
PS03W|No you can't no.
PS040|Oh Right.
PS03W|Like so it's sort of in one.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|sense Er.
PS040|Right So it'll have to be that one in there.
PS03W|And.
PS040|Oh So right Right.
PS03W|When Trish had a do in here her fortieth she let.
PS040|A what.
PS03W|er Trish had her fortieth birthday here She laid there's a tremendous amount of wasted space here really.
PS040|There is.
PS03W|Erm.
PS040|Ah This stage across.
PS03W|Yeah She laid out in here and people just wandered in off the back end here.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|But I mean we've always wanted to utilize this but we can't really we built that wall here and it's just a this is the back of the disco I mean al it's all none of it's sort of.
PS040|Determined wall.
PS03W|determined walls I mean it's no no wall there at all I mean we put this up just.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|to break that.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|because this is the console bar.
PS040|Is that Cola.
PS03W|It's for it's for the cellar yeah.
PS040|This is nice and big in n it.
PS03W|Well it's not I mean.
PS040|Should think they've had quite a few.
PS03W|Not bad Oh yeah Mm Obviously you've got a better eye tha than I have but er.
PS040|You wa er what you want in here is one tha is tha is what's e what's extraction like Is it good.
PS03W|Fine.
PS040|You want a chair for over here for doing.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|American stuff.
PS03W|Yeah you do yeah.
PS040|Do kebabs and everything.
PS03W|Yeah We've got erm somewhere a pizza oven.
PS040|Oh You have you got a.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|pizza oven.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah.
PS040|Right So that's alright I've enough afternoons.
PS03W|Well you won't need to do that now It's somewhere anyway we've got.
PS040|Jesus wept.
PS03W|pizza oven.
PS040|What is it.
PS03W|Ice making machine.
PS040|What's that a dishwasher.
PS03W|Glass washer yeah.
PS040|Glass washer I meant.
PS03W|We've got er.
PS040|Have you got one behind bar.
PS03W|No There's not.
PS040|There int one behind the bar.
PS03W|No.
PS040|Oh out in garden Oh right I see.
PS03W|So basically they've got ta just tray it up.
PS040|What you want is.
PS03W|tray it up here and then.
PS040|yeah here and then.
PS03W|bang it straight in Erm.
PS040|Why's your bar so high I can't reach your pump.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Have you.
PS03W|We like to keep the floor nice and sticky so the staff can't run away.
PS040|Oh I see.
PS03W|Once they're behind here they're stuck all night.
PS040|Think you got some cleaning you just want that back in.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|You know what I mean it's got And all that up there Mm Now then so you'd carpet them two.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|and then summat washed.
PS03W|Well you see hardly anybody ever sa they don't really sit in this area all they do is er I mean they only sit.
PS040|Around the bar.
PS03W|right at the end of the you know.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|when it's full they'll sit on those two tables.
PS040|You were going to clear that area anyway don't they.
PS03W|Yeah I mean everybody round here just stands or sits on those bar stools.
PS040|Mm Yeah.
PS03W|When people first come in they go for the raised areas and sit down O.
PS040|You have to see.
PS03W|or they stand at the bar It's and and if you actually look on the actual area we're talking about there's only one two three four there's only about half a dozen tables.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|Which is you know at maximum you're gon na get twenty four people sat around there anyway So I think in a way it's erm a bit wasted carpeting it all Cos it's a big area.
PS040|I do.
PS03W|to carpet.
PS040|One two three.
PS03W|I mean the quotes we had ranged from sort of.
PS040|Well you wo did you look to change the carpet.
PS03W|eighteen to twenty seven.
PS040|because of the name on it.
PS03W|Well yeah and.
PS040|You are.
PS03W|and it's getting past it to be honest I mean these metal strips are down there for the public entertainment license they weren't gon na give us it because the carpet was lifting.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|So I mean not weren't gon na give us it but we had to do it for.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|you know at the time.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|And you can see like like there can you see straight in front of you there's a worn patch on the carpet but there's er been a li a bit of a leak at some stage.
PS040|Oh right I see.
PS03W|There's one there I mean.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|if you've got it carpeted once you got that you you're you're stuck aren't you You know.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|you've either got I mean we've either got ta put a table on top of it or.
PS040|Yeah that's it or sit on there or get.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|somebody to stand with it.
PS040|you know Yes.
PS03W|Erm or replace the whole damn carpet I mean the carpet must have cost a fortune.
PS040|Bloody hell It must it must have been absolute arm and a leg.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|Absolute arm and a leg Er.
PS03W|But it it's not a bad size room in the sense that.
PS040|No it int no it's it is.
PS03W|in the sense that you can get three hundred in.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|well we often get four hundred in if you're you know I mean just have the right.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|party erm.
PS040|How many you licensed for.
PS03W|Three hundred.
PS040|Three.
PS03W|But you can get but a hundred people can have a decent atmosphere as well.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|You know it.
PS040|Well that that's good you see.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|cos I mean some places that are fairly big th the if you've got hundred in they just it looks empty don't it.
PS03W|No that's right That's right I mean.
PS040|Erm.
PS03W|that's the Carlton's problem in n it You know if it unless it gets.
PS040|Ooh God Yeah.
PS03W|unless he's got five hundred in yo yo you feel as if you're in a barn aircraft hanger.
PS040|Well that's right.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|But the sort of chromea and all that sort of lends itself to one of them aircraft things doesn't.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|it Yeah.
PS03W|It does It does yeah So you wouldn't have to spend a fortune on on on I mean it's only a matter of most of it's a matter of paint and then hanging a few things up isn't it Change the atmosphere.
PS040|Well er yeah well it is but I think cos one you've got to look at oh a bit of a design as well a while you're at it you might as well just get one or two bits.
PS03W|Oh yeah Yeah.
PS040|you know.
PS03W|Yeah yeah True.
PS040|Erm oh yeah One two it's alright I'm trying to think if you're gon na make all this into a dance floor and all the rest of it what's the be a er er er benefit of having a stage If all this is virtually gon na be it's virtually gon na be dance floor int it really.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|Well there is no benefit.
PS040|Cos if you didn't have that it'd make this room more viable in as much as erm the point of view of doing doing catering and functions and all the rest of it You can't you couldn't say right we'll do a function for hundred and fifty and two hundred and really to do you've got to be looking to do a a sit down function for two hundred.
PS03W|Right.
PS040|if you because it's more than the Headway can do.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|comfortably And it's more than er and you can certainly do a better job than the Carlton so I mean you don't call I mean you don't call him any competition at all I don't but you've got to look at being able to do functions for two hundred.
PS03W|Mm Well two hundred is lost in the Carlton anyway int it.
PS040|Well it is but having yeah but with their.
PS03W|Are you talking about the Carlton or the Carlton Rooms.
PS040|I'm talking about the Carlton.
PS03W|Right.
PS040|Not Chelstons.
PS03W|Not Chelstons right.
PS040|The Carlton up.
PS03W|Right.
PS040|here.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|It really and truthfully like the Headway do plenty of functions and the rest of it but you can do a better job than Headway.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|No two ways about wi it in a min in a But if you can do if if you can do a two hundred thing for sit down you're gon na be in among the functions.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|Definitely Plus the fact like you sa er like I say if you're gon na have a dance floor in here there int any benefit about having the raised area is there.
PS03W|No that's very true.
PS040|And er and it it it makes a lot of difference actually I would have thought so.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|I mean cos the bands can still set up can't they.
PS03W|Oh yeah.
PS040|If they sit up here.
PS03W|Well you can do what yeah.
PS040|Yeah But they still sit up there and they can still see them.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|And it's makes it a it makes it a different space totally different.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|And like I say if you're gon na carpet it er not carpet it you're gon na cover it you might as well cover it totally.
PS03W|Oh yeah Well.
PS040|I wonder what you'd use though.
PS03W|You ca you're gon na you're gon na cover it I mean we've got to re.
PS040|You've got ta cover that anyway.
PS03W|we've got to that.
PS040|That's what.
PS03W|stage anyway.
PS040|So you're not so all you're.
PS03W|So.
PS040|doing is taking that out but.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|surely in a lot of ways it might makes all the difference Barry.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|Makes it and it makes in a way so that it it's not a.
PS03W|Well you can create a dance floor area with tables and chairs.
PS040|Yeah course you can.
PS03W|All you do is just put them round there.
PS040|Just put them round.
PS03W|I mean that's all we did in the Sugar House.
PS040|Well that's terrific.
PS03W|they've got er actual flat floors.
PS040|Get rid of all that and you have got more table area because i they can sort of sit in th in the the.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|gangway.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|you know so I think I think that would it's alright I just keep freezing up.
PS03W|Do you wan na sit in there rather than.
PS040|No my I'm better stood here.
PS03W|Oh.
PS040|No I'm better stood here But I've got to I do this you know I just sit and look.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|Oh no I don't stand a lot.
PS040|Well that's but I've I've got to er so I think definitely that wants to come out Erm and er.
PS03W|Because I mean if you ever got anything you really need a little you could always bring a little stage in.
PS040|Well Yeah Staging's no problem is.
PS03W|No.
PS040|it.
PS03W|No.
PS040|You know.
PS03W|I mean.
PS040|now we need erm alright we're gon na we'll keep these mirrors and everything Them mirror tiles and everything.
PS03W|I should think so They cost us a fortune.
PS040|Cos I mean them marked I nearly ca what they call it Aren't they.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|Called the Er it's just that that just on that middle one actually that's bad int it.
PS03W|Mm Well I've yo you need to redo the the fixed seating I mean some of it o you'll get away with but generally you re you need to recover it it's going all over the place and it.
PS040|What if you could get something with stars and stripes on.
PS03W|Mm Yes but it's dirt on it The trouble with the American red it's a it's it's not a maroon it's a.
PS040|No it's.
PS03W|bright pillar box type.
PS03Y|Mm.
PS03W|red in n it.
PS040|Yes.
PS03W|You know it's.
PS040|Oh my God You don't want to.
PS03W|So if anybody if anybody spills anything on it or whatever.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|it's gon na show like a.
PS040|Yeah Well that's one's left cos that one well it's better than green when it's down isn't it.
PS03W|Mm But I thi.
PS040|I know that sort of creates that atmosphere there but I think erm sorry Go on Get them lamps down I think Cos I mean yo you can easily chop them off and put summat else smaller on can't you with lamps on.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|If you want to create that sort of an atmosphere Are we there int a door is there from kitchen to there.
PS03W|Well it's.
PS040|There's just a hatch which is alright.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|because then well that'll just do service from there but the only trouble about that is that Anyway not to worry.
PS03W|Alright.
PS040|Round again then Nay problem.
PS03W|I mean if you've got a function you haven't got that much of bar trade.
PS040|No but.
PS03W|in the sense that.
PS040|No.
PS03W|being busy have you.
PS040|No.
PS03W|You know.
PS040|No No And is erm yeah I think that'd make all the difference if that comes out You can soon redo the DJ's little er.
PS03W|Oh yeah No I think you'd leave the DJ's.
PS040|Oh yeah but I mean you can soon sort of make it so that it's er.
PS03W|Oh yeah well Jean keeps buying.
PS040|it's extended.
PS03W|Jean keeps Jean keeps buying these this atrocious cheap wallpaper and sticking it everywhere.
PS040|Oh my God.
PS03W|Look at that.
PS040|Well yeah it looks erm you can put same thing up but properly.
PS03W|Oh yeah Yeah.

PS03W|what and what I'd do is I'd put a few more spots in.
PS040|Yes.
PS03W|no those spots around.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|there shining on the.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|floor put some round the back so.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|you actually just use.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|see but I er I think creative use of spotlights is better than than specialized lighting effects which A cost a fortune but B.
PS040|And you get out of.
PS03W|as soon as you've seen them they're out of date.
PS040|Well that's it That's right.
PS03W|Cos they're only effective one time that's the first time you see them.
PS040|yeah.
PS03W|After that it's.
PS040|And we don't want to fork I mean.
PS03W|No No So erm I mean you can just use coloured spots it in I mean those at the moment are just literally stage spots all they are i are on and on dim.
PS040|Oh right Yeah.
PS03W|then you can dim them up or whatever.
PS040|Yeah I have them.
PS03W|but they can't flash.
PS040|No.
PS03W|so what we need is a small unit in there and and I mean it's only two or three hundred quid er and a few erm.
PS040|Most places where erm you know they've got them in that where you go to.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|you can pick stuff up for next to nowt Just have it made say you want it for.
PS03W|Yeah Well marvellous.
PS040|But I think er er yeah I think that's definite take that out it really it really would make the difference to erm.
PS03W|Yeah it would actually thinking about it.
PS040|Would it'd make it it'd make it well it'd just transform it I mean just no two ways about it I think You've got that erm what time's that chap coming half past three.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Well I think er is this alright if I look in here or.
PS03W|Yeah course.
PS040|I'll just get my erm.
PS03W|Yeah I mean i it's keep on walking round till you get familiar with it.
PS040|Yeah well that I mean I just yeah cos I need.

PS03W|It's a pain in the neck But it's er.
PS040|Well that's how it is at the minute in n it So.
PS03W|But now Volks actually looked at erm buildi putting a lift in and building a lift to it.
PS040|Oh You can't be doing with that.
PS03W|I mean but okay well all it means is you get twen yo once you start getting busy you get twenty twos not elevens I mean.
PS040|And thirty sixes eventually.
PS03W|And thirty sixes that's right.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|But er we've got three stand up freezers and the.
PS040|Yeah you could have loads there's there's loads of room if you could ge if you if you bring that do it in here.

PS040|Which then would make.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Oh my God Done it again.
PS040|I thought I'm hearing yeah you could make a ra er you can make another hatch.

PS040|You see and er.
PS03W|Well that's where I mean you can make money on the food sometimes can't you And that's that's where you've got.
PS040|Make the money yeah And this is why takes to get all this down and get get a location better than the Carlton for the I mean alright we aren't gon na be able to do the three or four hundred but then we.
PS03W|No no.
PS040|I can't imagine anything worse than doing a function for three or four because by the by the laws of average how the hell are you gon na get it out to them all as it should be.
PS03W|I mean de a I I think he doesn't do a bad job on to be fair.
PS040|No he doesn't.

PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|well it's all laid.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|out.
PS040|Well they'd like I'd like to know.
PS03W|They've got ta imagine it you ought to have like a pull.

PS040|Say that we want it set up in here with a photograph and that wants to be on the thing outsi.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|in the cape outside.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah.
PS040|Erm but to do but like I say if you've got somewhere that could just er er you see cos I mean what the most we can do is fifty.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|down there.
PS03W|That's right.
PS040|Then er which is nice i it forty's lovely Forty's absolutely lovely to do And that and that's it but I mean to do to have somewhere to do two hundred like this would be absolutely incredible Could always do small weddings down there and and then the big do.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|at night up here That'd make that just totally makes it different I want to just go and have a look in them you see if you've well anyway Well erm I might get to a certain extent Cos you're nearly.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|aren't you.
PS03W|Mm Again this is look it's the same as this Shit.
PS040|Well where's that go.
PS03W|That's the fire escape down to outside.
PS040|Oh so you couldn't you'd have to leave them.
PS03W|No you can't no you can't no But that's that area we were looking at Either side of the disco console That's the passageway we just walked down And that's the area you were banging.
PS040|Oh that's where I were banging on wall.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Right.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Well that'd be fine because then it means that you've got either you've got your back in.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|and out or whichever way.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|round you.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|want to do it So that fine all this comes down And you can still sort of ma make it elevated up this really nice and.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|whatever That's that wallpaper int it.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Right so this is.
PS03W|It's actually you know if you took the time you make a tremendous it'd make a tremendous big area wouldn't it.
PS040|Brilliant.
PS03W|No messing.
PS040|Right depends what the and quite honestly if you bring these down and make them a bit more romantic.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|you know.
PS03W|God knows what they'll get up to.
PS040|Well I a don't give a bugger me.
PS040|I aren't bothered for them Fifteen there's fifteen there and whatever they need here Thirty seven See you could seat fifty on here.
PS03W|Yeah I I think I ca I once upon a time I did on the fixed seating for for I think you could get about a hundred and twenty round.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|there.
PS040|O as it is.
PS03W|Yeah As it is.
PS040|Yeah Packed out Er.
PS03W|But you see the other thing the other thing that er that's worth when you've had the smaller dos you know.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|sort of even even like sixty eighty people you can lay one of these raised areas out as the big cold buffet area.
PS040|Oh the buffet yeah Yeah.
PS03W|which kills a lot.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|of space in the club.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|The only thing that worries me about taking that out is that you then create a massive empty space if you have got.
PS040|No you don't.
PS03W|sixty seventy people you have to then.
PS040|No you don't because what you do is you do it down there.
PS03W|Well.
PS040|And this is off.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|in n it.
PS03W|Yeah Then you go back and sit up there.
PS040|That's it.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Yeah You do it down there and this is erm if you did it over there it would look absolutely dreadful You do it down there you set it up in the middle and you set it up really nice and cosy.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|And then er.
PS03W|We got a lot we got a quite a lot of these little blue tables so you could actually.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|surround the dance floors.
PS040|Oh yes No no.
PS03W|but we.
PS040|messing.
PS03W|push you know push people into the dance floor so they're there anyway.
PS040|Yeah and you make a totally you make a totally different erm it's it in one sort of minor operation if you like alright minor to a.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|certain extent you've totally transformed it Barry.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|And it it.
PS03W|That's right.
PS040|definitely looks so different I mean even if you didn't do anything else.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|But I think erm you've just got to er we've just got to er gerrit sorted It it it int gon na take much sorting and get the you know.
PS03W|Mm We could use that chrome railing around.
PS040|Well you co.
PS03W|area.
PS040|yeah you could use that chrome railing elsewhere we could.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|you know I don't think you you've you've got to try in a way not to shut it off too much erm and yet it i you've just got to sort of be able to not shut it off but sort of create different areas.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|within one big area i i if you can and I think shutting things I think putting trellising up to not trellising but that sort of thing to a certain extent at the minute we don't need and I think I'll have to come a time er too when it's open as well to get.
PS03W|Now wha what I was just thinking of.
PS040|Yes But it could be just on a Saturday and Sun.
PS03W|is it if you if you're using if you're gon na use it as a pub as well.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|on a Saturday and a Sunday.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|which I think you can do with Amer certainly in the summer season if you Americanize it and all that and and just well I mean we we did.
PS040|You could have a glorious MacDonalds couldn't you.
PS03W|Yeah That's right Then you know you wan na start from that and build back out bits.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|you know.
PS040|Definitely.
PS03W|cos I mean if they walked into here on stood on that bar hundred and twenty people.
PS040|Well actually you don't want them you want them in here and bar's there.
PS03W|Well that's right.
PS040|And that's the bar they use.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah That's right.
PS040|You don't sort of use.
PS03W|No we have that closed and.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|and try and sort.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|of shutter it off in some.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|way I mean maybe.
PS040|Well I think.
PS03W|maybe even getting literally shutters rather than those grills And then you can.
PS040|No I think I think I think.
PS03W|I tell you what we had Laura Jean's daughter had erm a nurses' dinner here it was about the they wanted to come on a on a disco night but.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|they wanted a meal beforehand.

PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|and we put them onto that area.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|and er and I said to Laura ah I know I'll put so I'll I'll I'll put something on the big screen so you know some videos whatever I said ooh I'll tell you what I've got Live Aid all taped on you know from years ago.

PS040|Mm.
PS03W|I mean we must they must spend twenty quid a head at the bar.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|at least.
PS040|We could get them here nicely.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Be absolutely.
PS03W|But we but we go to the Carlton well so.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|I've been to I mean we've been all round but the last three years we've stayed at Carlton.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|I said he's done a pretty good job.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|But there's no reason why you don't do you know.
PS040|But I I tell you really you'd you'd and something different because I mean like you go to the Headway and it's just the same.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|the beer's bloody awful.
PS03W|Well the other thing that's really good is cos you've all got that set up cos it is a disco.

PS03W|up and.
PS040|No no messing about no.
PS03W|testing the equipment and all that sort of stuff.
PS040|No no no No you see it's all there I think.
PS03W|The D J.
PS040|that's.
PS03W|plays background music while you're eating.
PS040|While you're eating.
PS03W|and then winds it up when you.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|when you want you know.
PS040|When you want yeah Mm Yeah It makes makes it you know and then we jus you just ah have we'll just have I mean ceiling's right in blue so I mean.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|you know What sort of paint is it that.
PS03W|Well these damn these bloody tiles cost a fortune They say just I mean we yo th there's bits and pieces of like you know.
PS040|Yeah I mean.
PS03W|like you have to redo some of tiles but a lot of them.
PS040|Er excuse me Ooh Pardon me.
PS03W|And even things like the cocktail side I mean although you never use it it's a bit of a joke I mean it actually fits into American bit dun n it.
PS040|Ah yeah it's Americanified yeah course it well you can make co you could make cocktails.
PS03W|Oh I know you could yeah.
PS040|without no messing couldn't you Not expensive ones either.

PS03W|Is there.
PS040|They used to be absolutely beautiful there but they're crap now.
PS03W|Well that's.
PS040|or whatever it is.
PS03W|That's the problem in n it I mean one yo yo be you get good because of the reputation of doing something and and the one person.
PS040|And and one person doing it yeah.
PS03W|doing it and then because you're good everybody comes and you cease to do it you're upstairs doing the books instead.
PS040|Mm No not me.
PS03W|and you employ staff.
PS040|sunshine I.
PS03W|Ah.

PS03Y|That's more American anyway.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|And I mean you can create a dance floor by the tables and just lighting round it I mean that's all it as I say I don't know why I didn't think of it cos in the she well I do know why I didn't think of.
PS040|Why don't we make that like a rebel fort.
PS040|That would be that.
PS03W|Like the Alamo you mean.
PS040|Yeah.
