PS03W|Mm mm.
PS043|start asking.
PS03W|Mm.
PS043|then that transport you could ask about putting it back on again.
PS03W|I mean what a what I think I'll probably do is if we can get like erm something that's obviously our crowd and then either putting say Stella back on or something like that.
PS043|Mm.
PS03W|and banging it out for one.
PS043|Can you not stick a band on pretty soon or nothing like that.

PS03W|when we had that thin Martin's band on.
PS043|Yeah but I was in.
PS03W|I mean.

PS043|Er I mean if you if they if they.
PS03W|There was about a hundred with thin Martin on the other hand.
PS043|Yes Yes It was a really good night that If you make it known that there's stuff like that going on if you get a band like that you can always just.
PS03W|Mm.
PS043|put a bus on for some people that come down.

PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|You know so it's like yo you've got on this minute camera on the line and everything you know so it so that you can actually get the excitement of watching it you know coming and taking.

PS03W|Shark fishing's only.
PS040|That's all you have that's only have to have a little bit.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah.
PS040|You've asked for a lot.
PS043|Can we have a lot of a discount please.

PS040|Yeah Fair enough.
PS043|No.
PS040|Well isn't it.
PS043|Well I did.
PS03W|The guy was talking to Pete he thought he could he develop he could develop for coarse fishing.
PS03Y|Bye bye.
PS03W|er you know river fishing and that as well there's spa special camera.
PS040|Well where does the actual camera hang off.
PS03W|It's hung it it's hung i i it's actually not below the boat but but it.
PS03Y|Oh Sure can.
PS03W|get it you see but i it's fantastic watching cos you know they were they they it was sort of going along the.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|whatever they were using as bait presumably some mackerel or something like that but but as I was saying you could see it trailing through and then all suddenly out of like nowhere this fish would come and like chase after it.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|and snap and this this would go off and you'd be sat there going right then you actually.
PS040|Well presumably.
PS03W|see it take it you know.
PS040|the camera eye would be adjustable would it Or.
PS03W|I presume so yes I mean they was talking about getting a really small for erm.
PS040|Oh right.
PS03W|you know to be to be used in in sort of coarse fishing and that.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|But of course the other thing of course i it takes out the the one that got away cos you actually see the one that got away.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|you know.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|There'd be some story then.
PS040|You know what'll happen is your camera would.
PS040|the cameras'll magnify it anyway won't it.
PS03W|Yeah it will It will do Yeah Yeah But it was really I mean it it meant of course that the other people on the boat could have some enjoyment as well cos I mean there's nothing worse i if you if there's only one rod out or two rods out th those boats there's only like a couple of rods out int there on on.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|those for the marlin and the and the sharks and that fishing.
PS040|And you don't get many.
PS03W|Yeah And it's not like sort of.
PS040|Three there'll be.
PS03W|twelve.
PS040|three or four maximum.
PS03W|twelve rods out yeah.
PS040|something like that.
PS03W|Yeah So any anybody else that's going on board is bored out their brains basically But at least.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|if you got T V monitors you can watch what's going.
PS040|Watch it.
PS03W|on.
PS040|That's really good.
PS03W|So now now I mean now with all the radar and whatever else we're using I mean you should really be able to find fish.
PS040|Well that that boat from Evesham that we went out on a couple a years ago it had a fish finder on it.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|So it er fish finder on it.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|You throw your line out you don't get a few just biting.
PS03W|No No that's right That's right They've done most of them are I mean the wo certainly the ones on the little little boat trips and that I mean they have all it does is that it'll tell you there's some fish about I mean it doesn't.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|tell you where to fish or.
PS040|Oh no.
PS03W|depths or anything like that does it What they're doing is there's some fish down there somewhere.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|Cos that's the most frustrating thing about fishing is when you're like you know you could be wasting that you you think to yourself like I could be wasting a whole there's not a fish anywhere round here You know you could be sat here like an idiot today.
PS040|Well that's it I've I've sat on.
PS03W|for hours on end.
PS040|Jay hours on end in middle of night freezing.
PS03W|Mm.
PS040|you know like and I've caught nothing And you've.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|thought well there's plenty of crabs in.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|summer take your bait.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|but every time you throw out there's a crab on end of it You know.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah.
PS040|you think why does that crab always have to come my line.
PS040|And all this sea yet it has to get my worm And same like no fish you think well there must be fish out there.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|Well it's it's luck in n it I don't know.
PS03W|I don't know what's going on I don't we got about three three thirty in the morning both of them went out to er canal somewhere up Dulgate past Dulgate we set up and we'd we'd been fishing for about two and half hours it's aba about six thirty in the morning this old farmer comes up says er aye aye lads he said er I wouldn't bother it they drained this area of the canal a few months ago And we said oh.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|Sat there watching our floats for hours I mean.
PS040|Yeah.
PS03W|I mean luckily you you know you'd gone on a car with a car so it's a matter of throwing everything in the back and just going.
PS040|That's it.
PS03W|somewhere else so could have sat there all bleeding day And not have known anything about it.
PS040|Aye I've had some lonely nights.
PS03W|Yeah Do you catch many eels eels or anything many eels.
PS040|No.
PS040|Didn't catch as many this year as what I have done Phworgh The slimy things that they are.
PS03W|Yeah.
PS040|You get one of the lads that works with me if he catches three of them he says well I'll have them for my dinner.
PS03W|Yeah I know I know.
PS040|They look horrible.
PS03W|A delicacy Mind you I ate conga I I erm I was off the west co er on a holiday to the west coast of Ireland and we erm we're driving down the west coast and there was like some rocks and everything about so we stopped and you know I looked by a rock pools or something and there's this and the rock pool is like mini-swimming baths they were you know probably.
PS040|Mm.
PS03W|twelve foot long and about six or seven foot wide and about.
PS040|Mm mm.
PS03W|six or seven foot deep and they're crystal clear And there was this old guy dragging this bloody rope with a massive hook on the end like after after you know I presume it was cod or mackerel something along the and I said what the hell are you fishing You know cos the woman I was with wanted to go for a swim and I said no you can't this guy so I went up to him I said what what on earth are you fishing for He said oh there's three congas live in this pool It was like a four foot one a five foot one there's a six foot one over in the centre there's a rock in the centre of it.
PS040|Oh right.
PS03W|that came out the water said look over there I said bloody hell You know and I said to her you were gon na go swimming in there He said ooh he said there was some American students here last week and they were all swimming in there and the man came along with this thing and they bo they were all sat on the middle lo middle of there with their feet dangling in the water splashing away he said I was dragging this down and this six footer came out I said and then they were he said you've never seen anybody run so fast in your life like they go.
PS03W|they were dangling their toes at the end of this thing Yeah.
PS040|Yeah Oh aye.
PS03W|And then the next day I went along and he actually caught the five foot one and ki and killed it and he gave us a load of steaks off it that I sort of.
PS040|Baked.
PS03W|Yeah Yeah.
