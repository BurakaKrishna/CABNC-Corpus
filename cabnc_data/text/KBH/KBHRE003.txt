PS05D|She was about to but she found a sticker on book.
PS05F|She comes out well on tape doesn't she.
PS05B|Who Charlotte.
PS05F|Mm I didn't realise how clear her speech was until I heard it on the tape It's really quite good actually.
PS05D|Not bad.
PS05F|Oh we'll do this one again.
PS05E|drop off.
PS05D|Cos it's lights and things isn't it She was looking at er lights in Sainsbury's the other day It looked like that didn't it.
PS05D|Carol was swaying at her.
PS05B|You missed that I just swayed at her and she.
PS05E|It's Conway Twitty isn't it.
PS05D|Is it Oh no How far back does this go I suppose early fifties.
PS05D|Er nineteen fifty six I remember Conway Twitty.
PS05B|Oh yes You were in your cradle Elvis didn't he.
PS05D|I don't think he ever recorded it I think he just used to sing it at his er sort of cabaret.
PS05B|Well so many of these songs have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that that Because there's one there one on one of these that er either Paul Simon or Art Garfunkel or someone can't remember which one probably Art Garfunkel as Paul Simon does all his own doesn't he.
PS05D|Well he has done other people's.
PS05B|Well there's one on there I can't remember.
PS05D|Like for instance the er what do they call those two Oh the two brothers In the.
PS05B|Everley Brothers.
PS05D|The Everley Brothers that's it You know Wake up Little Suzie.
PS05B|Oh yeah.
PS05D|Well Simon and Garfunkel did that.
KBHPSUN|Wicked far out it's a groovy record this.
PS05B|Shut up.
PS05F|Can't remember which one it is but I'll recognise it when I hear it.
PS05D|He's doing very well isn't he.
PS05B|He is Have to employ him full time He's always quite good.
PS05F|I just can't believe how daft he is.
PS05B|I suppose you like that film.
PS05F|Yes.
PS05D|Forget it.
PS05B|You're not having cake.
PS05F|Does she like cake.
PS05B|Well she's looking at it.
PS05D|So how's things down at the.
PS05F|Not too bad Quite good actually.
PS05D|Yeah.
PS05B|Keeping him busy out on estimates and.
PS05F|Yeah he's out all this week Well my dad won't pass them on to Terry Me dad said he's had enough Well we were debating whether to give it to you or not But I thought well if Terry notices he might Well in fact two really big estimates.
PS05D|Who Terry.
PS05F|Yeah And one wanted re-estimating the other one wanted a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done We give them a provisional kind of price and not really gone into it in detail So she had a list of about five things she wanted sorted out and she said so far we were the cheapest But she's got about six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes So I worked out and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all down to Terry to sort those out And they're both about two to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pounds worth of work.
PS05D|Well you can't afford to lose them can you.
PS05F|No.
PS05D|So what's going to happen then.
PS05F|God knows He said I asked asked well I left a message on Saturday for him to sort them out didn't I He already knew about that And then I asked my father on Tuesday to remind him and he said he'd already said he'd fetch them in on Tuesday And he my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning But he's he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices So I don't know Well I mean he'd done he's done this first estimate these are all just polishing touches cos people are obviously interested in you know they're well keen on our prices.
KBHPSUN|they can't pursue it till we come back to them.
PS05F|They're not pursuing it until we put these things out My father just turned round I've had enough of it if Terry's not going to do the estimate he passes them on to Brian I said yeah then I get into trouble with them for not passing estimates to Terry and then there's an argument If he if he says anything to me I'll just have to tell him But he's not doing the estimates he's been given and he can't afford to throw money away It's cos he's working for him at the moment money He always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he hasn't worked for him He forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings the other way I mean Brian's pulled in a lot of work lot of people kind of saying come back again on Thursday So he's he's If we got Terry to do that we'd be well away They they would love him I mean one of them it was annoying really cos Terry's just not pulling his weight.
KBHPSUN|I don't understand it if I live to be a hundred I won't understand it.
PS05F|And also it's cos that you know after we had that row about Terry after Bank Holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop and er he's already owing Brian a day Guess who's doing the extra day got my dad to cover a day And then he takes a day off Bank Holidays and he can't do it because my dad But then tomorrow he's actually doing his own work So he could easily have And on Monday.
PS05D|So who's covering tomorrow.
PS05F|Well my brother's covered practically all week and Brian's doing tomorrow Terry phoned up asking what Tuesday morning about quarter past eight said who was covering And he said well my father is doing today I can't do today I'll do it Friday and I shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you shouldn't be going in I mean he hasn't been in the shop once this week Somebody's got to tell him to.
PS05D|So do Dave and Terry in the shop.
KBHPSUN|They have the records.
PS05D|And it hasn't been sorted yet.
PS05F|Oh no He's got the gall to phone up on Tuesday and say Eileen can't do a day we're going to be short of Eileen.
PS05D|So the answer is to just phone them.
PS05F|I can't do it.
KBHPSUN|I'm not doing it.
PS05D|What's the point of carrying on like that.
PS05F|Well he's going to carry on like that isn't he Not unless someone puts their foot down.
PS05D|And if your father is currently taking your side of things worth sounding him out as to how far he'll take.
PS05F|Ah.
PS05D|whilst he's in the mood.
PS05F|Yeah He's not being that much.
PS05D|You sure.
PS05F|Mmm He's probably only in the mood cos he's probably upsetting them on his night out cos they go out in the evenings On a Wednesday evening don't they Cos Terry.
PS05D|I mean wouldn't he rather have Terry as a sort of permanent worker anyway.
PS05F|It's not being fair.
KBHPSUN|do any work.
PS05D|Oh what your dad.
KBHPSUN|Pauline's dad er.
PS05F|too expensive I think Terry uses the shop to get extra money every so often uses my dad ticking over running when he.
PS05B|Why He does get the offer I mean.
PS05F|two months and she phoned up and I kind of made out it got lost in the post I erm got check you've got two days you've got give me the estimate it's got to be on because she's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent And he actually got that one done Do you know it was only five lines I mean I could have made it up it was that easy So I sent that off She was in first thing I mean I sent it off that evening she was in first thing the next morning yes that's fine So he's got that job and another one.
PS05B|She's trying isn't she.
PS05D|I don't understand why it surprises you that's what gets me I mean.
PS05B|It's normal behaviour Charlotte's done it too.
