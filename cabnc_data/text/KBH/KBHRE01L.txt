PS05B|Yes she has now Well she her her sleeping habits during the day change to afternoons and well today she's been she had about two hours this afternoon so if we did our normal and gave her tea at fiveo'clock and send them up for a bath at half past six there's no way she'd be asleep.
PS05D|No.
PS05B|So we sort of switched all around now so she eats with us at half past six stroke seven goes up for a bath at seven thirty eighto'clock and she's in bed by nine then she she's usually asleep by half past ten but eh it seems to have cured the problem we had with her wanting wanting me all the time after she's gone to bed.
PS05D|Yeah.
PS05B|So seems to be working.
PS05B|Well this one seems to go to bed a bit later now so she goes longer but she's feeding all day today I'm at every couple of hours so with a bit of luck I'll finally put her to bed maybe half past nine teno'clock she might go through till three or four which isn't bad.
PS05D|No.
PS05B|It's usually half past nine till I wasn't so good last night she went until two but then she didn't wake up again until seven Manages to do long stretches at night which is nice.
PS05D|Yeah.
PS05B|And then she went to sleep again until ten on our bed.
PS05D|Mm.
PS05B|She's reluctant to go back in her own bed so I just point her over me shoulder and lay and said get on with it an insult lose his sense of smell in the wet.
