PS05B|If he's showing me something or is before I start a new piece he'll always play it.
PS05D|And yours sounds nothing like it.
PS05B|No well certainly not the first time I play it I approach it when he thinks I've finished but it's nowhere near I mean.
PS05D|Provisional expect to sound as good.
PS05B|Mm.
PS05D|so.
PS05B|concerts and things but you can you can tell with just just by listening that it's not just any old body tinkling on the piano it's wonderful it makes you sick.
PS05D|Is Charlotte going to learn to play it.
PS05B|Well I hope she'll be interested enough to but not really before she's six cos I asked him last couple of times ago he said what sort of age cos obviously the size of the hands comes into it they can't do too much but he said he wouldn't consider before six and you ough t'a have to take the parents into consideration of a child that age you got ta have a parent who's prepared to sit there and make sure the child does what he's set them to do because oh Amy you not getting any out of that Have you finished it Ha you big lump No wonder she puts on half a pound a week Mind you erm I mean that's not it's normal I expect you to put between six six ounces and eight ounces Oh dear oh dear it's a hard life isn't it.
PS05D|taken it off.
PS05B|How you doing.
PS05D|Eh oh O K I'll find out tonight.
PS05B|Oh of course Wednesday.
PS05D|The way in to work cycled there last week.
PS05B|Oh my.
PS05D|I had to Richard had taken the car he takes it in the morning but.
PS05B|Oh my goodness.
PS05D|Well he he takes the car to school but and it sorry takes the car to work and before he's bringing the car home and then he's been going to school on his bike.
PS05B|Oh right.
PS05D|So of course the bike the car's for me to use in the evening but last.
PS05B|You cycle home from here and then.
PS05D|from you then you get changed and then go but last week he took the car cos when I got home first I was late last Wednesday well I say late I didn't get back here erm until seven so by the time I got home it was quarter past seven and I have to make sure I get to Weightwatchers between seven and eight.
PS05B|Oh for the weigh in.
PS05D|Mm so I had to go quickly get changed and cos it it I normally I just wear a pair a pair of sandals and light weight clothing but.
PS05B|Oh dear.
PS05D|so I couldn't go in sandals well obviously I can't cycle in a pair of sandals on.
PS05B|Can't really cycle with a floating skirt on either can you.
PS05D|The last with me leggings on and this top on Well I looked a bit of a sight but I thought well well you know what else can I do I mean I couldn't take clothing to get changed in to.
PS05B|Well they wouldn't expect you to would they.
PS05D|I've I'd got a few stares from some of the women there I mean there are some women there that are huge and maybe they looked at me and thought oh I hope I can wear leggings like that one day I mean I don't think I look too bad in the leggings I mean I would never have done it when I used to go to Weightwatchers when I was thirteen and a half stone I would never of gone in leggings no way but it doesn't.
PS05B|Well you don't you don't really look as if you need to lose weight cos it's probably why you got a few stares it's like all the diet books that have sylphlike people on the front.
PS05D|Well I mean I spoke to Jane the other Sunday and I I said to her you know just be honest I said I don't care what you said but just be honest and tell me how much you think I weigh cos she doesn't know how much I weigh and she thought I weighed about ten stone I said well stick thirteen pounds on top of that then you'll be right she couldn't believe that I that I weighed that much so obviously it doesn't look that bad and people at work well they've noticed that I've lost weight but they don't say how much they think I weigh so I don't want come to them to sort of have a have a g have a guess of my weight.
PS05B|Guess the weight of a Suzie.
PS05D|Yeah but they have noticed which is something I suppose There's somebody came in today a guy came in today who used to work with us who usually comes in occasionally and I would see him but for a few weeks now so he noticed it It's nice that people say it to you unprompted.
PS05B|Oh yes you say I'm on a diet they say oh well you have lost a lot of weight then.
PS05D|Yeah.
PS05B|Adam's mum's like that.
PS05D|Oh is she.
PS05B|She knows you're dieting every time she sees you ooh you've lost a lot of weight.
PS05D|Even when you haven't yeah but erm no I mean there is a guy at work I mean there is a guy at work that's constantly saying to me oh it's really noticing it's really started he says this every day and he after a while I mean it's nice to be told it once in a while but not every day.
PS05B|But not every day it loses value doesn't it.
PS05D|Oh it does and he said to me erm this afternoon he said eh oh he said eh your weight loss is really really noticing this week and I thought well even if I had lost weight this week it's only going to be a couple of pounds and a couple of pounds would not notice.
PS05B|Plus the different clothes you wear.
PS05D|It doesn't matter who you are two pounds won't make any difference to your appearance I mean yeah I suppose clotheswise.
PS05B|Well as you as you get smaller two pounds does notice it's when you're.
PS05D|Maybe it does.
PS05B|when you're bigger and you've got a real lot to lose and two pounds is nothing.
PS05D|Yeah two pound is nothing yes that's true.
PS05B|Two pounds is actually quite a lot.
PS05D|Yes it is.

PS05D|Oh I have have well I've got high heels on but it's it's because I am.
PS05B|Yeah I know what you mean.
PS05D|Because I'm a bit patterny flowers with this little bit here and being cropped there just made my leg look a bit and I thought oh dear and I wasn't convinced Richard couldn't stand them he thought I looked absolutely gross in them.
PS05D|So I thought well I said I like them and he said you can wear them as long as you're not out with me So I thought well there's not much point in me having them cos I would wear them.
PS05B|If you find something unacceptable there's not much point.
PS05D|Well I I'd be wearing them at weekends so you know just just just slouching around in really well you know perhaps cycling yeah.
PS05B|Not in front of the husband Cycling.
PS05D|So I thought there's not much point in me keeping them if he really does doesn't like them at all he.
PS05B|Well done.

PS05B|She got those from M and S didn't she.
PS05D|Yes.
PS05B|Cos they looked really nice with that jumper she wears.
PS05D|Yes so I thought I might erm cos I bought a jumper I bought a pale blue jumper to go with the flowery leggings but I've decided I'll take blue jumper back cos although it would be alright with plain white trousers I thought that's all I would wear it with I wouldn't wear it with anything else so I think I'll change that if I get the dark blue leggings like Jamie then I'll get the striped jumper the same.
