PS05B|Lovely very very good indeed that that is there now sounds very good just erm a few little things would you try to give me more on the fifth finger the E the E flat there think of a crescendo to that want that come out then then it will erm I'm almost frightened to put a crescendo in because it wasn't the a big one.
PS05B|No.
PS05B|If I put that in to remind you to bring that up.
PS05B|Aha.
PS05B|I thought this was most impressive very very good indeed it it was it sounded really very convincing it did worked beautifully now where the only error as such is this bar you're making these much too long you're making them almost crotchet length.
PS05B|Mm.
PS05B|But so erm just think there for a moment one two one two and one and two and you're going one and two and one and.
PS05B|And.
PS05B|So you're halving the tempo but it needs a slight roe that means just lead into it so two and one can do that but you're doing and it's instable for ever.
PS05B|Right.
PS05B|And then you know it it makes that sound strange so just watch that that erm what if we just pick it up around here just for me to hear that and get that right we ought to be fine any.
PS05B|And one and two that's it got it erm the better we just do to check that it's correct and to remind you for rhythm is listen to those because those are exactly the same as those.
PS05B|Yeah.
PS05B|Just once again this time.
PS05B|Two and one and two and one and now there you just make the crotchet a bit too short erm try until you get it into your system which you will just counting that in inside yourself.
PS05B|Mhm.
PS05B|And you'll find then that that that will fit can you just adjust your.
PS05B|This.
PS05B|Yes.
PS05B|Work out what fingers should be.
PS05B|F sharp.
PS05B|And one two and and you've got it yeah yeah do it once again and try the other thing is try not to hold down that D as you play the C it's not important but it's better if you don't.
