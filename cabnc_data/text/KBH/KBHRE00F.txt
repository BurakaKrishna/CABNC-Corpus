PS05B|I was I was tempted to sell it off cheap but I don't want to sell it off too cheap cos it's.
PS05E|Grandma Grandma Grandma Grandma Grandma why's that.
PS05B|because of the price of the frame is quite expensive in itself.
PS05J|Yeah.
PS05B|But if that I mean it doesn't worry me if I don't sell that cos it's quite pretty in poppy.
PS05E|Grandma Grandma Grandma.

PS05B|Some mug might buy them.
PS05J|then little dog may be erm won't go perhaps for that much.
PS05B|Well no there's no no mount or anything on that one it's just as is that was a the cheapest frame I could do cos I didn't like it when I finished it and I begrudged the price of the frame.

PS05B|Oh well you can buy him if you want.
PS05J|No I don't want him but I still think he's quite nice I mean.

PS05J|No.
PS05B|I'll give it height but I wouldn't buy it.
PS05J|So they're the only ones you want to get rid of or are they the only ones you've got.

PS05J|Yeah.
PS05B|But I I really couldn't I would never get the price I would want for the alphabet.
PS05J|What would you want for that.
PS05B|Well I'd want over a hundred for that.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|Cos it's got an expensive frame and it's a lot of work.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|Ha.
PS05J|What's the matter.
PS05B|Don't you think you better wait till she comes back Save me getting up.

PS05B|Well he's a well known artist.
PS05J|Well yes I suppose he is.
PS05B|That helps.
PS05J|Yes I suppose he is but I mean those two those pictures we bought were hundred and twenty and I mean they're they're only done by somebody in the village.
PS05B|Well yeah I mean the answer is.
PS05J|But we like them.
PS05B|you pay what feel don't you.
PS05J|Yes.
PS05B|If you like something enough you know what you can afford and what you're willing to pay for it and if it's priced more then you don't buy it.
PS05J|That's right.
PS05J|But you see something like that might just appeal to somebody an embroidered picture.
PS05B|You never know we will give it a try.
