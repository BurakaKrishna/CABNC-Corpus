PS05B|Difficult.
PS05B|just try it.
PS05B|Then a four.
PS05B|Good Yes now I wouldn't slur those quite so much as I would make that all legato You try putting a thumb on the A no do do this slowly making the whole thing legato.
PS05B|The thumb da da yes but if you're in it's a cord of G you'll put a two on the B final note and then go up to a five on a G not a one it's better to do that see if you can try.
PS05B|That's it do you find that difficult.
PS05B|No just awkward.
PS05B|If if if you can't if you prefer to put a one there cross it out with a vengeance.
