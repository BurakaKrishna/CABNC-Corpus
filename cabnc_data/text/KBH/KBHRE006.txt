PS05F|Mind you my hair was a lot better when I was having it done.
PS05B|I must admit though it looked lovely I'll say that.
PS05F|I only had a trim but the blow dry made it sort of Do you remember when I got that my hair cut really short They did that and that was that was really nice When I look back at the photographs I think And even when it was long I had there was one hairdresser there called Paul whom I'd go and see regularly I'd go and see him regularly because he did it really well once he left.

PS05B|They're not having a cigar they're walking round the block They're not having a cigar So they keep telling me.
PS05F|They've gone out for a walk to have a cigar but as far we're concerned they're not having a cigar.
PS05B|They think we're stupid and we don't realize.
PS05F|Well I'm not supposed to tell you but he was smoking on the station when we just caught sight of him.
PS05B|Well I'm sure he was.
PS05F|I said how am I not supposed to say anything I said I don't approve why should I keep this quiet Cos it's not good for you It's not on.
PS05F|Brian is because we've been out a couple of times and he does I mean if we go out he'll smoke then and then he just normally stops.
PS05B|Yes he had one to celebrate but he didn't just buy one he bought a box So of course he had to keep smoking them until he'd finished.
PS05F|Until they'd gone yes.
PS05B|And he told me well quite soon quite soon after she came along I think he actually went for a walk with Brian.
PS05F|Oh I assume he brought.
PS05B|No no this was the last one I said you had the last one two days ago So the last one of packet number I don't know what.
PS05F|Well Brian can stop terrible now he's really snoring god I've got to the point now I kick him and tell him to turn over he turns it over and it's just as bad as before.
PS05B|Yeah yeah.
PS05E|I don't want to be married.
PS05F|No don't bother.
PS05B|Well at least have separate rooms.
PS05F|I wouldn't mind but it's normally me that goes and sleeps on the settee and I don't see why I should Well no the other day he said if I'm really that bad you just tell me and I'll go down and sleep on the sofa And I went berserk about two nights later and said for god's sake you're driving me bonkers go away and sleep on the sofa He's turned over and started snoring.
PS05B|Well he can be lying there sometimes and I'll say will you roll over please Mm Go on then Mm Will you please roll over Or some of the time I've been sitting there in the bed feeding the baby you know.
PS05F|Mm.
PS05B|and go shut up Shut up It's awful.
PS05F|Well I've found now I do a combination of what's that stuff erm orbathol that seems to help a bit I don't think it helps him it helps me calm down and go to sleep.
PS05B|Knock out drops.
PS05F|put that all over I keep forgetting to take those herbal tablets they seem to help with colds or whatever but I haven't got those upstairs at the moment which doesn't help And then last night I just took my stuff and knocked myself out instead I don't see why I should have to knock myself out.
PS05B|have to be a man unfortunately.
PS05F|Trouble is I go into such a deep sleep I can't wake up in the morning if I do you know take the herbal stuff I I'm flat out in the morning can't wake up I think I got up about half past eight this morning.
PS05B|Goodness me.
PS05F|I had to go to work about nine.
PS05B|Oh what are you doing Oh shut up Go away.
PS05F|And he gets hiccups He eats too much too quickly He gets really violent hiccups though you know really th they sound very very painful.
PS05B|My baby's ones do.
PS05F|Mm You know when it you can just hear everything going ckkk ooh Is she awake.
PS05B|No I'll have to put you down some time.
PS05F|I felt so sorry for Christine Do you know she's now she was quite cuddly she was fat in the pregnancy when I saw her last time And in the space of three weeks I think the baby's used up all her fat because she's now just really really pregnant But not so much her face but all the top part of her looks slim almost you know I mean she's got no fat left there on her arms it's all gone Just a bit left on her legs so the baby must have used up all if the baby carries on like this she'll be anaemic I think.
PS05B|When's she due Did you say.
PS05F|Eleventh so she's got another almost two well two weeks ten days.
PS05B|Mm.
PS05F|She said she can't sit down can't stand up I was just sitting there for about five minutes then she got up then she ooh sat down then she got up I don't think it can be too long.
PS05B|Now what about that then I can't believe how quickly the time's gone.
PS05F|Mm.
PS05E|Do you want to sit down.
PS05F|broke today.
PS05B|Ooh broke.
PS05F|I mean I was one minute I was walking round I hadn't touched anything another minute it was catching my finger I looked down to see what was kind of stinging my finger and the ring had snapped and was pinching where it caught my finger.
PS05B|I can't get mine off.
PS05F|Well I can't wear a wedding ring now it just cos it's so wide it's a really wide one And if I wear where I had the eternity ring on and the engagement ring and the wedding ring.
PS05F|it just felt like arthritis it used to get really painful So I said oh blow this that's coming off I suppose I'll have to get another wedding ring It's fashionable to have a kind of reason.
PS05F|I don't think so So I'm feeling less and less married the more rings I keep breaking.
PS05B|I can't get my wedding ring off.
PS05F|No Well my fingers get swelling as well so I thought it wouldn't do any harm.
PS05E|Well I have finished.
PS05B|Well they're all up there.
PS05E|O K Well I could not ask you before.
PS05B|Well yeah if you look ooh I can't think where I think there's a book-rack up there and I think some of them the patterns are out of the magazine and they're just in a rack I think If you go up there just leave them as they are don't leave them all over the place put them back.
PS05F|Are you making something.
PS05B|Depends how much time I've got.
PS05E|Yeah.
PS05F|What are you going to make.
PS05E|Some.
PS05F|Yeah.
PS05B|What the ski lycra type one.
PS05E|Little.
PS05B|Lycra.
PS05E|Oh that one no.
PS05B|fabric Do you want the fitted or loose.
PS05B|You want like like that floaty.
PS05B|Like like these or more like jogging pants.
PS05E|No like these.
PS05B|Well if you want them to stay pretty as opposed to going baggy then you'll need to have a bit of lycra in the fabric Keeps the shape better.
PS05F|Mandy loves her top.
PS05B|Oh the body The body.
PS05F|Yeah she was wearing it flat out when she was.
PS05B|So you didn't get a look in then.
PS05F|Oh no I was wrestling it off to wash it in the end She kind of wore it with everything she could think of I think that would go Mind you I don't think it's come out of the washing at the moment I think it's getting water I haven't seen it recently.
PS05B|Quite versatile really.
PS05F|Yeah yes she wore it with a lot of you know trousers and skirts and The big thing at the moment is a new polo neck that we got from It's actually ever such a good one An X Together one you know Together the label.
PS05B|So.
PS05F|Yeah But you also buy it in er Alders they've got them So it's normally quite expensive and it's it's lovely material and it comes down to about here We got it for four pound fifty Ever so cheap.
PS05B|That's.
PS05B|Oh right yes I've seen it I've seen it.
PS05F|Well ever so often what they do they get the ex catalogue stuff You know you can get some quite good buys like end of the season.
PS05B|Who are they.
PS05F|You get the end of season and it's if you look at the labels and go for the decent labels then you don't get sort of quite reasonable quality.
PS05B|Mm.
PS05F|I got quite a few things in there I'll probably have a stroll round there just to get a tracksuit for when Michael was.
PS05B|childrens' tracksuit.
PS05F|I used to I bought loads and loads in there.
PS05B|Joelle Could you just take the carrycot up and put it on the floor Just so that it's upstairs for me.
PS05E|On the floor bedroom floor.
PS05B|Well I haven't cleared the cot out so.
PS05E|O K.
PS05F|it's funny cos I just I thought ooh I'll buy it for her cos you know she doesn't.
PS05F|four pound fifty I didn't mind But it actually really suits her it's a kind of sl almost maroony red burgundy type red not quite and er it's a really good colour Christine got a load of her pregnancy stuff there Cos she said I'm not paying a fortune for stuff that I won't wear afterwards So she bought.
PS05B|Is there maternity clothes then.
PS05F|Well if you look yeah Well she got a kind of raincoat that I don't think it's supposed to be maternity I think it's just supposed to be.
PS05B|Oh yes cos that was the fashion wasn't it.
PS05F|Yeah yeah So she's she's got one there I think she paid eight pound for it and it it looks raincoat And it still fits it still fits over the hump But she's huge.
PS05B|I really got away with it you know I didn't have a coat right the way through.
PS05F|Mm when it rains that's all.
PS05B|Really lucky.
PS05F|she hasn't got a car or anything She's.
PS05B|Oh dear.
PS05F|So she has to walk round well Chris sold his car didn't he cos they want to save up and get a house.
PS05B|Even through the snow I survived Very lucky Cos I refused to go out and buy a coat.
PS05F|I used to wear one.
PS05B|I had a jumper that my mum knitted that went wrong and ended up twice the size it should have been But that came in useful.
PS05F|Yeah Well when Mandy was when I was pregnant with Mandy I used to wear this old you know those rabbit skin coats coney coat what they're called Fur coat thing.
PS05B|Mm.
PS05F|Well it was a kind of fur coat but it was rabbit I think it was I got one ooh well it was really fashionable then so it was quite beautiful sixteen years ago.
PS05B|I'd probably know what you mean if I saw it.
PS05F|It's just a little jacket kind of thing So when I was pregnant that would be that was fine cos it just.
PS05B|Sat on top.
PS05F|Yeah sat on top really And er with Michael I'd gone out in Richard's and bought mys ever such a full raincoat when it was in fashion I still had it in the wardrobe so I just used to But I still had more room than I needed in that so that was quite useful Actually Christine normal size twelve dress that happened to be a full dress.
PS05B|Oh a baggy one.
PS05F|And she's she's quite it's a kind of cottony stretchy you know those ones that you have a V and then they're quite full like this is full from there.
PS05B|Oh I know yeah.
PS05F|This is like a V Well theV's just kind of gone up It actually looked quite nice on her She didn't look too bad considering.
PS05B|I hardly wore any dresses.
PS05F|Well she's got she said she just wears the three I don't think she likes like the trousers.
PS05B|Oh it's boring isn't it being pregnant Because you don't want to go and buy as many clothes as you would have in your wardrobe normally.
PS05F|The killer is when you've got to go out to a special occasion isn't it.
PS05B|Yes.
PS05F|And you know you've got to.

PS05F|She's put on a little bit of weight.
PS05B|She has put on a bit but.
PS05D|I tell you what Suzy Suzy's problem is her rump and her her.
PS05F|Yeah her legs.
PS05D|and her thighs That's where she.
PS05B|Because if you look at the top of her you you wouldn't think.
PS05D|No you wouldn't think she was overweight Take a picture of her head and shoulders.
PS05B|Mm You'd think she was skinny.
PS05D|Mm.
PS05B|Well she went right down to a size ten when she lost all that weight before.
PS05D|What is she now.
PS05B|Fourteen.
PS05D|Blimey.
PS05F|Mm So she has got a problem then.
PS05B|It's all round the bottom Mind you cycling should help that She's out cycling here and getting the train in the morning Keeps her bike in the garage and pops on the train.
PS05D|So you don't need a lot of.
PS05B|in the garage.
PS05F|No that's right.
PS05D|jacket Mind you isn't there some restrictions on what you can do with fridges.
PS05F|I think you can ask the council to take it away or something or take it to the dump.
KBHPSUN|you can take it down the tip.
PS05B|They recycle cfc's don't they.
PS05F|That's right yeah.
PS05D|Really goes against the grain to see.
PS05F|Mm Well we don't really need another one We've got a fridge in the at work there's one in the kitchen.
PS05B|Can't you find.
PS05D|Can't you find what.
PS05B|or something.
PS05F|Well it's difficult isn't it really Because it's it's er under under worktop.
PS05B|Well if if they enquire they're only enquiring.
PS05F|That's true Just ask for a fiver Cos if you say nothing they probably think there's something wrong.
PS05B|not working so they don't want to take it have to get somebody to take it away.
PS05D|Well I think it's going to be a case of phone the council and ask them to.
PS05F|Do they take them.
PS05D|I don't think I'll get it in the car anyway.
PS05F|Who's asleep proper now.
PS05B|now isn't she Pardon.
