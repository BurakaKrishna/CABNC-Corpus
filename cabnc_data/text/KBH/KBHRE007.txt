PS05F|Do you remember provisional driving licence Now how long has she left that sitting there Ages isn't it I thought I'd tidy up in his desk and I was just going through the mound of papers and I said here you are here's your licence finish it off fill it in and I'll give you the cheque Oh right I'll and then she's moaning at him cos she wants to go and post it and you were mucking about with your C D thing or something and you were saying wait for me I'll do this then I'll miss the post It's been sitting there for about three months On the desk and she hasn't bothered probably with the cheque.
KBHPSUN|How are you going to afford a driving licence Totally ignored me.
PS05F|Oh of course expecting us to pay.
PS05B|Oh that's a nice choccy.
PS05F|She sounded really cheesed off about I said how's your revision going cos I knew she was doing revision she went cccckkk I try a maths paper and I can't do that and I a chemistry paper and I can't do that and I really I said I think you need a break I think you need to go and do something else for a little while I said cos if you keep looking over thinking you can't do it have a break and go back to it afterwards you just get really despondent.
PS05B|Yeah.
PS05F|and fed up and think you can't do it and you go blank and then you can't touch anything you and you know it's hard.
PS05B|Mm.
PS05F|Yeah You know you can see it ticking over What am I doing She was fine tonight wasn't she.
PS05B|What was she doing.
PS05F|I du n no I think she just probably gone down and played some records or something She's got to do some trigs and she just doesn't fancy trying doesn't understand enough of it to do it And the science paper she's only got the the kind of practice one it's a very basic one She's got no practice ones for the two the other two she's got to do which are obviously going to be harder and she's got no idea not well she's got the guidelines but no real paper to sit and look at.
PS05B|Mm.
PS05D|This is for gcses isn't it.
PS05F|Yeah.
PS05D|Mm.
PS05F|Well you'd think they'd let her you know have some old paper.
PS05D|Does she have or not.
PS05F|Yes she erm.
PS05B|There aren't any old papers yet though are there.
PS05F|Well yeah this is done in Croydon last year and the year before so yeah there would be a couple.

PS05F|Nice idea.
PS05D|Mind you that's what motivated my brother in M S.
PS05F|Mm.
PS05D|cos he had a he had it had it as a kiddy Went through so many operations he felt he wanted to give something back to the Health Service.
PS05F|Well I think that's the kind of idea this girl's got Cos that's right we took we took them all skating when Mandy was twelve Yeah when she was twelve And that's when that week well she already knew she had something wrong.
PS05D|Mm.
PS05F|and about two weeks after that it was diagnosed that she had cancer of the ovary Yeah.
PS05D|Cos she had all her bits removed presumably did she.

PS05D|Has it all come back.
PS05F|Oh yeah She's all fine now.
PS05D|Is she fully full recovered.
PS05F|Yeah I think so yeah From what I can gather.
PS05D|Very lucky.
PS05F|Mm Yeah because it was pushing everything You know it was taking up so much space Wouldn't think there was the room in there for for women I was really worried at the time cos Mandy Mandy was very worried wasn't she.
KBHPSUN|Mhm.
PS05F|It really seemed to hit her hard Actually her friends have gone through a lot I mean what with that girl and cancer and then another good friend her father died Then it's quite a lot to happen isn't it Really makes her think Or worry.

PS05F|Yeah she's walking and she's slow at walking though Yeah she looks alright says she's not very well she's got a thyroid infection infection in her throat it's affecting her stomach They took her down the hospital And they diagnosed that and said try and keep you know give her fluids but it's going straight through And they've given her something low in glucose and that you know to kind of try and stabilize it a bit.
PS05D|Mhm.
PS05F|But she's not too good by the sounds of it Mind you I saw her two day's ago and she looked absolutely fit as a fiddle so I said I think it strikes quickly and.
PS05D|Mm.
