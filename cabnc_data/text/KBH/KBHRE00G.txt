PS05B|Depends on the colours you're having to use really.

PS05B|What th the flowers on the black.
PS05J|Yeah.
PS05B|Yes it is nice it's okay if you can do it in daylight but artificial light is difficult and I used to sit in the car when Charlotte was asleep.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|She was went to sleep in the car I used to sit in the car and do it cos the light was good out there.
PS05J|Yeah it was nice and bright yeah Is that what Joanie bought her.
PS05B|This Yes.
PS05J|Yeah Isn't it pretty.
PS05B|It is pretty.

PS05J|No Is it time.
PS05B|Mm mm.
PS05J|Oh ooh half past three What time did she go off half past one.
PS05B|Oh she'll she'll probably be asleep until five now.
PS05J|Oh.
PS05B|Once she goes she goes.
PS05J|Oh well cos she should really she should go four hours shouldn't she she's got good jollop well she.
PS05B|Yes.
PS05J|seemed to have.
PS05B|Well yes but I mean it's she seems to do the opposite thing to Charlotte cos she used to sleep in the morning and fidget around in the afternoons and this one fidgets all morning and then sleeps in the afternoon.
PS05J|Yes well.
PS05B|Which is which is quite handy I suppose.
PS05J|And then is she awake in the evening.
PS05B|Yeah.
PS05J|Yeah well that's not so bad as long as you can get her down at a reasonable hour and get to sleep.
PS05B|Yeah well she she sleeps she goes down some time between eight thirty and eleven.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|But sh I think what she does she confuses her early and late evening feeds.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|so they merge as as sort of one solid feed.
PS05J|Yeah.
PS05B|all da evening but then like last night see if I know that she's been chomping on and off all night she'll go for four or five hours.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|Or five or six hours.
PS05J|Yeah.
PS05B|at night.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|So and there you are.
PS05J|Mm Makes you uncomfortable though presumably does it or.
PS05B|Ah no it's a it just lets down every now and again.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|and it's sort of well it's not well they do get full that's if she suddenly does longer than.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|she's been doing.
PS05J|Yeah.
PS05B|Then it's overflowing.
PS05J|Oh is that why you got that out again.
PS05B|That's right.
PS05J|You got your pump out again.
PS05B|Yes yeah well I've got two ounces in the freezer.
PS05J|Oh have you oh well it's something I suppose.
PS05B|Yes well if I can do a few two ounces worth I put them all together and then Adam can give her a little bit.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|So I can make the dinner or do something useful.
PS05J|Yeah.
PS05B|Cos I don't tend to get the opportunity.
PS05J|No.
PS05B|Cos she starts fidgeting go and hang this lot up I suppose Want to come upstairs.
PS05J|Yes I'll come upstairs That's a nice bread then isn't it.
PS05B|It is a bit big that's the only problem but the amount of bread we get through I need a big one.
PS05J|Yes you couldn't put it all in the at once could you.
PS05B|Well no no plus the fact that the lid got broken so that.
PS05J|Oh that's a shame.
PS05B|Yes dropped by a certain clumsy person around this house unfortunately we've had a lot of breakages.
PS05J|Oh dear.
PS05B|Yeah never mind So Adam said buy something that doesn't break.
PS05B|We've lost loads of glasses.
PS05J|Oh dear.
PS05B|And the lid of the bread bin.
PS05J|Yeah.
PS05B|So and she ca I don't know whether you noticed or she can't make a cup of coffee without spilling it.
PS05J|Yeah she she spilt it when she put yours down.
PS05B|Yeah.
PS05J|Yeah.
PS05B|She just can't she's incapable of doing that without spilling it.
PS05J|She's a bit of a Jamie isn't she.
PS05B|She's a clumsy clogs that's why I won't let her walk around with the baby if she wants to cuddle her I tell her to sit down and I tell her not to move well she's always tripping over her feet.
PS05J|Mm.
PS05B|I'd rather not take the risk.
PS05J|No that's right.
PS05B|Don't want her to go flying do I.
