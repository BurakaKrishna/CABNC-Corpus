PS0AJ|Oh I don't know she's had stuff taken from the placenta and all that's as well yeah.
KC5PSUN|That's it that's what I had they told and they said that it might be that she's just she's just is small for her size but it might be that Katie taken all the goodness from Hannah.

PS0AJ|Good God they reckon hers is gon na be three and a half to four pounds.
PS0AJ|Yeah yeah.

KC5PSUN|Yeah.
PS0AJ|Course she's worried cos like she smokes a lot and she's say what thirty and that's her first and they keep going on to her all the time like I said well don't worry about it you know.
KC5PSUN|she does feel guilty perhaps she can just try and cut down a bit now.
PS0AJ|Well she has she has yeah she's gone from twenty to five.
KC5PSUN|Well.
KC5PSUN|And it is five do you know what I mean it is like what I used to say to Rose.
KC5PSUN|I mean Adam's lucky in that respect I couldn't smoke when I was pregnant I it made me feel sick I couldn't stand the smell of it I had no urge to smoke at all I went right off smoking I respect I was lucky but I do feel sorry for these people that smoking at present cos it must be ever so hard.
PS0AJ|Yeah I didn't smoke for the first six months and then I finished work and I was at home.
KC5PSUN|And you got bored.
PS0AJ|yeah and I used to go round and see our Trace every day and she was still smoking.
PS0AJ|and er so I used to I started again and then I didn't smoke until I come out of ho when I come out I didn't smoke.
KC5PSUN|Mm.
PS0AJ|for about a month six weeks cos I had so much on me mind.
PS0AJ|yeah there's only three weeks between Nat and Neill.
KC5PSUN|Yeah she's.
PS0AJ|yeah yeah.
PS0AJ|Neill he was seven pound odd so it makes you feel sometime you think that makes you think well it didn't affect you know.
KC5PSUN|No.
PS0AJ|but there again everybody's different aren't they.
KC5PSUN|I think they have got a point I think it might it might.
PS0AJ|Yeah yeah.
KC5PSUN|have some effect on the baby.
PS0AJ|Well it's got to I think we've look what it's doing to yourself.
KC5PSUN|Yeah I think it must have some effect there.
PS0AJ|And seeing you've got another life inside you it must be doing something to them mustn't it.
KC5PSUN|It's bound to harm I mean I know what you said when he had all that problem he sort of said reckon cos I smoke.
KC5PSUN|You know I think you always bring the blame back don't you.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
KC5PSUN|That's.
KC5PSUN|Yeah.
KC5PSUN|I mean if your child was born with one arm you'll still fucking blame yourself for it wouldn't you at the end of the day.
PS0AJ|Yeah yeah.
KC5PSUN|It must be difficult like I said I was lucky in the respect that I had it never ever appealed to to the minute I got pregnant from the minute.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
KC5PSUN|I I had to really stop meself.
KC5PSUN|That really turned my stomach even if I mean I remember when I was carrying when I was carrying the twins and he used to go out huge things you know and so much so that if he came home in the night right and I was already in bed asleep I would be able to er he would wake me in the bedroom cos I could smell smoke on him but he didn't smoke but where he'd been the pub or a night club I smelt.
KC5PSUN|In the pub yeah.
KC5PSUN|He smokes now though didn't he.
