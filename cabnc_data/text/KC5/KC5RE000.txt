PS0AJ|Yeah only just that's.
PS0AL|When she comes in keep this out right.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AL|And when she comes in what's that one put her left foot on it right.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AL|And if if her foot overlaps it all take them back cos you might be better off just getting two anyway.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AL|cos Scott's Scott's in a two football boot there sort of thing in n it.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AL|She's gon na wear her thick socks with them dangling aren't they.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AL|That's what I'd be inclined to do so.
PS0AL|on top of the telly and say just put your foot on here a minute now they look quite thin now but that's what I was looking at yeah cos her feet are fat yeah but they that do like that don't they.
PS0AJ|Yeah that yeah spreads out to the side anyway don't it.
PS0AL|Yeah put these Try her foot on it and if it don't if her foot overlaps.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AL|then take them back up and get a two Cos the thing is as well I might be inclined to get a two anyway because she wants it to last a little while don't she.
PS0AJ|Anyway yeah.
PS0AL|They're not gon na last very long not a like that is it Is that how it was.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AJ|That was quick.

PS0AL|If erm.
PS0AJ|Go on.
PS0AL|if her foot's wide wider than that would it matter.
PS0AJ|Well yeah cos it ought to be tight on her across.
PS0AL|But if her foot's wider you'll get the bigger size it'll take it up on the length bit.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AL|So I'd be more inclined let me have a look at her when she comes in send her up.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AL|see is it I mean sometimes Scott's foot too wide for a both sides.
PS0AJ|Mm.
PS0AL|Yeah their trainers upstairs they still they fit alright.
PS0AJ|Yeah.
PS0AL|They're not tight that's why I went for a one cos I thought it's like a trainer in n it.
PS0AJ|Yeah yeah.
PS0AL|You look quite a way.
PS0AJ|Only other thing I can you do is try it on when she's asleep.
