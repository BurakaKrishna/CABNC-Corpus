PS1C8|Aha.
PS1C7|I'm sure I'm getting a lot of fumes coming back out er.
PS1C8|you said that a couple of weeks ago.
PS1C7|I mean yesterday after I had me dinner I dropped off to sleep for a couple of hours cos.

PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|like Jimmy next door he's always dropping off and he got a vent put in at the bottom of his door they took the pipe out and behind you had a big open.
PS1C8|yeah.
PS1C7|which should of been bricked right the way in.
PS1C8|that one's got a brick opening like that that isn't bricked in.
PS1C7|No well that's supposed to be bricked right in so it doesn't allow the fumes to accumulate inside.
PS1C8|it's it's a good size as well.
PS1C7|Yeah.
PS1C8|that size.
PS1C7|and that's what they've done all then that done ripped it.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|they clamped a big label on well they didn't clamp one on ours so I take it was.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|supposed to be alright.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|but over the years you sit there and ya you know.
PS1C8|well it must be the fumes.
PS1C7|yeah.
PS1C8|and what this thing up what's that up there.
PS1C7|in the summer it doesn't happen Well that's supposed to be a vent.
PS1C8|Er that's the vent is it.
PS1C7|it carried the fumes away.
PS1C8|Oh I see.
PS1C7|any surplus fumes around.
PS1C8|aha have have you got one like that.
PS1C7|Oh aye but when the bloke went next door to Jimmy's he he said where's your vent and Jimmy says there it is up there ah and he got up there.
PS1C8|I thought.
PS1C7|he says I see you've got a towel up there.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|regarding a fire it's no good whatsoever he says your trouble you're not getting a draught from your.
PS1C8|yeah aha.
PS1C7|from your front door coming through and carrying the fumes away.
PS1C8|cos it'd have to be circulating around wouldn't it.
PS1C7|this part of the fire he says Jimmy says well I'll put a label on it then well why don't ya You're supposed to break a.
PS1C8|well that's commonsense.
PS1C7|he said well that's the trouble you could break the.
PS1C8|I would say that's dangerous.
PS1C7|then he says you want a vent in the bottom of your door.
PS1C8|Door aye erm.
PS1C7|so when when they came the three of them.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|Ginger.
PS1C8|mm mm.

PS1C8|oh that'll be a different kettle of fish.
PS1C7|and er.
PS1C8|wouldn't it.
PS1C7|Hmm he's wife says he says ooh er she was when he went in the back says I'll be honest yeah he says you're minding the right ooh he says er they wan na get erm you know and.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|so he went back and he says er oh he says er he says oh dear like he says well carry on he says I'll have to take the door off so he says can you give a hand to hold it cos he had to cut er this er like and all grown at the bottom of the door you know with.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|six inch.
PS1C8|put one of them metal things in.
PS1C7|and you put a grid on each side like a plastic grid you know.
PS1C8|oh yeah mm mm I know.
PS1C7|and there was only these er little screws more like a nail with a a little spiral on.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|and what you doing you didn't screw them in you just break them in.
PS1C8|oh yeah.
PS1C7|and the spiral grips the wood you know.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|so he says I tell he says er he put the card up where the machine is which he bore a hole in I've got one of them mach er cutters you know a a saw with a little braid on.
PS1C8|oh yeah.
PS1C7|and you can cut all different shapes you know.
PS1C8|mm mm mm mm.
PS1C7|and he when you drill a hole in the corner each corner and he just put it on he just oh it were real lovely and it was as simple as that.
PS1C8|ah yes yes yeah aha.
PS1C7|he didn't clear clear the hole or nowt he didn't.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|when he put the grid in that that caused.
PS1C8|I see.
PS1C7|you know took an hour down and he just got that done but I I've meant to ask him if those have made any difference you know having done in.
PS1C8|yes.
PS1C7|the griding that brick in.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|but er that is the trouble half of these are not been put in properly and the fumes are coming back over.
PS1C8|well it it could cause the many a couldn't it.
PS1C7|and that's I'm sure I put over the years.
PS1C8|Mm.
PS1C7|where you're sitting in and she used to nod away.
PS1C8|I know she used to say that.
PS1C7|aye and er when you wake up ooh you're your throat's pouring you're hot you've got ta get up.
PS1C8|Stands to reason doesn't it.
PS1C7|and stand at the back.
PS1C8|That's right.
PS1C7|the you know to cool off what I do know before time I woke up er phew the you know.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|and lovely I just woke up er a couple of minutes before then the insurance lad come cos when I only he should of come yesterday and I waited in but I couldn't you know when I opened the door I says I I he says you know.
PS1C8|aha mm mm.
PS1C7|where you been I says where you been aye he says aye he says my fault he says I didn't get round did I So this tiler were there with that you know I says well why you know and er I went back in and I turned the fire off altogether.
PS1C8|Well it's sensible cos it's certainly.
PS1C7|cos it wasn't it wasn't that cold you know in the room so I says well I I wan na create more fumes which one am I locking up.
PS1C8|it seems fairly warm I still think it's nice and warm.
PS1C7|Well you don't get much draught cos the fr well the front door see that's the door here.
PS1C8|yeah mm mm.
PS1C7|you come in our front door there that was a passage when you get a draught from the front door it passes this door and it goes straight to the back down the stairs and back.
PS1C8|it's what you call straight through to the very end of the mm mm.
PS1C7|you see.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|door one door to another door.
PS1C8|that's right.
PS1C7|you get a straight through draught from the front door through the passage then it doesn't into here.
PS1C8|not do.
PS1C7|and then it goes through to the back now his although it looks.
PS1C8|similar.
PS1C7|the same as our house when you open the door here.
PS1C8|mm.
PS1C7|his front door the same you've got er the stairs going up there.
PS1C8|mm.
PS1C7|but when you go into the passage his door he's got the door into the front room same as ours on the left but when you get into the bottom of the passage there's a brick wall in front of ya and it comes round and his door to the back dining room is on this side here.
PS1C8|oh yeah mm.
PS1C7|so he doesn't get a straight through draught like me.
PS1C8|no you not do.
PS1C7|by having that wall at the bottom.
PS1C8|that's right of course.
PS1C7|the draught always follows where there a you know two doors.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|two windows open.
PS1C8|that's true.
PS1C7|but when ya when you stand at the front door and er there's a blower breeze and it's cold if you put your hand round the door like that you can feel a draught you can feel it colder than the you know and the letter box the draught but if you take that and put a curtain up it'll keep the cold out you've stopped the draught so you're gon na win.
PS1C8|The draught from that's yeah so you're not sure whether you're doing the right thing or not.
PS1C7|Yeah so you know.
PS1C8|so it's true mm mm.
PS1C7|I said I du n no what to do for the best so I just leave things the way they are and er hopefully that er you get some warm days where you needn't have the fire on so you don't have fumes you know.
PS1C8|true mm mm.
PS1C7|if.
PS1C8|well you're better again Jim you've got the fire er so you put the fire you put the fire off well this central heating comes from the back of that fire doesn't it so if you've got the central heating on and you've got it on full.
PS1C7|Aye.
PS1C8|blast for the water won't you get the fumes just the same as what you do from the fire.
PS1C7|No because because the fire at the back is actually at the bottom of the chimney.
PS1C8|Ah I see yeah yeah.
PS1C7|if this here is in the room in n it.
PS1C8|mm that's right.
PS1C7|So you'll have fumes.
PS1C8|of course it is that's right and so where the fumes from the central heating.
PS1C7|coming back through the side here.
PS1C8|go By the side here.
PS1C7|They got your central heating for your water.
PS1C8|Yeah.
PS1C7|in behind the wall there.
PS1C8|yes of course that's right and that's in the front.
PS1C7|you know the fuse.
PS1C8|it's come.
PS1C7|oh your fuse is all at the back the.
PS1C8|yeah.
PS1C7|pull it up the chimney.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|now that's the difference.
PS1C8|yeah.
PS1C7|I mean.
PS1C8|that's right.
PS1C7|you can.
PS1C8|it's er coming into the room isn't it.
PS1C7|you can tell er what a draught is like in that room I shall tell you when comes.
PS1C8|Mm mm.
PS1C7|and they'll be here half an hour or three quarters of an hour he smoked four cigarettes now it takes all day and all night to get rid of them fumes of his cigarettes.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|they travel up the stairs your you knew this room and when with being in it all the time you you know you your nose gets.
PS1C8|mm yeah.
PS1C7|well if you went out the back for ten minutes.
PS1C8|and it's strong.
PS1C7|and you come back er and you come back in here you would smell it again.
PS1C8|that's right of course you would mm mm.
PS1C7|and that's how you can tell there's no draught because the smoke can't go out anywhere.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|it's trapped I mean I I open me front erm front window.
PS1C8|aye yes.
PS1C7|and I opened up back.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|two of the two of the little window.
PS1C8|yes.
PS1C7|and I left the door open here.
PS1C8|mm mm that's the only way you can get.
PS1C7|to try and drive.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|but even it took all day to er to get a.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|there was still that little smell of that it's.
PS1C8|yes.
PS1C7|got a funny smell that smoke you know.
PS1C8|I hate the smell of it.
PS1C7|er er the cigarette tobacco an'all.
PS1C8|I hate the smell of cigarettes since I've packed in smoking I can not stand it.
PS1C7|it's got a funny.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|smell now but er I can't understand how the war and the would cigarettes years ago you know and they start that.
PS1C8|yeah yeah.
PS1C7|get it and er they've brought the full and then they say if you must smoke smoke then with a filter tip one and that.
PS1C8|that's right.
PS1C7|will half chop of the nicotine and whatever you know.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|just but that wasn't good enough the bloke that wrote in he says oh later on er even the filter is no good.
PS1C8|that's right cos yeah the if you take.
PS1C7|you'll still get cancer.
PS1C8|er the cigarettes to bits that's black inside.
PS1C7|yeah you'll still get it to you you'll still get cancer with it cos er it's coming through and you're still getting it on your chest.
PS1C8|mm.
PS1C7|well you can not win.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|no if I remember rightly during the war when the only cigarette that had the filter and it wasn't a filter oh it was a.
PS1C8|You'd have to suck.
PS1C8|yes that's right.
PS1C7|no it wasn't a filter all it was on the end of a cigarette what you put in your mouth it was a cork tip but there was no filter no filter inside it the tobacco come right to the end.
PS1C8|that's right.
PS1C7|all that cork tip was for was to stop it on your lips.
PS1C8|stop it sticking to your lips yeah that's right.
PS1C7|cos you know er you know.
PS1C8|yes that's right I think it were the first ones to come out.
PS1C7|really yeah er er introduced er later on but the one filter all it was was a cork tip.
PS1C8|yeah mm mm.
PS1C7|you know.
PS1C8|yes that's right.
PS1C7|I'm sure have it as time's getting on the they seemed to be introducing more health things in I think that now that tobacco er vegetables all the likes of that is different now what it was forty fifty years ago.
PS1C8|Oh.
PS1C7|because they're treating all these things that we are eating.
PS1C8|mm mm.
PS1C7|drinking.
PS1C8|mm mm.
