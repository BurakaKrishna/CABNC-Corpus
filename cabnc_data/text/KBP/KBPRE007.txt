PS065|The broom.
PS066|The broom yes.
PS065|Erm.
PS066|different coloured broom.
PS065|Oh for the back Yes.
PS066|Yes I think erm we'll have to have a trip to St Ishmal's for that.
PS065|Probably Where else could we go.
PS066|Erm well we do.
PS065|Other than that er rather expensive.
PS066|Well what I I do like about St Ishmal's is the way it's laid out and.
PS065|It's laid out but the plants look healthy and they're kept in healthy conditions.
PS066|They do Yeah.
PS065|Mhm To me that Dingle place.
PS066|I wasn't very struck on that.
PS065|I wasn't at all struck no.
PS066|No I wasn't.
PS065|There were all weeds growing among the plants they're selling.
PS066|Messy.
PS065|Yes messy And it wasn't just the messiness I don't mind that but.
PS066|No.
PS065|They weren't looked after.
PS066|cos you it was difficult to find the things that you w you want oh I don't know it was just.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|it didn't erm didn't appeal to me somehow.
PS065|No.
PS066|But erm I remember when we got the original broom that we've got in the garden now the golden one.
PS065|Yeah Where did we get that.
PS066|We got that at St Ishmal's.
PS065|Did we Mm.
PS066|And erm they're sort of labelled you know what it gives you this picture of what you're buying as well.
PS065|Oh yes With most of the plants it does yeah.
PS066|Yes cos I want to get the particular one I want.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|to go next to the.
PS065|Well obviously yeah.
PS066|you know for the effect and erm.
PS065|For the for the contrast yeah Mm.
PS066|I want to know the height.
PS065|Mhm.
PS066|it's going to grow.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|I think it's er I think it'll look nice there.
PS065|It should look quite attractive.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|It might be a bit of a job erm keeping them separate growing into one another.
PS066|But I don't think so.
PS065|No.
PS066|Oh no.
PS065|Oh.
PS066|Well it doesn't really matter.
PS065|Oh that's alright then Good.
PS066|Because I mean they don't sort of grow out they grow up don't they.
PS065|Yeah but they do grow out a bit too I mean the one at twenty seven.
PS066|Yes I know but not enough it wouldn't really matter if that a little bit of it.
PS065|No no No no no no.
PS066|cos that's the idea.
PS065|Mm I suppose so yeah Mm.
PS066|Did you see you know this last gardener's.
PS065|Gardener's World.
PS065|I haven't really looked at it no I glanced very briefly at it but.
PS066|Where it had er a broom garden.
PS065|No I didn't see that.
PS066|Oh let's have a look and see if I can find it And I thought.
PS065|Some er excellent photography there you know.
PS066|I know.
PS065|Mark you most of.
PS066|There's a primula.
PS065|There's a what.
PS066|I think that's what they call a cowslip now.
PS065|I've no idea.
PS065|Saturday or Sunday.
PS066|Saturday You know where I've put you know down the bottom end of the garden th that little bit of digging To shape the ga er where the grass is Right up in front of the sweetpeas.
PS065|Erm the left or the right.
PS066|Right down at the bottom there by the apple tree.
PS065|Do you mean where the daffs are going.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Yes Oh yes.
PS066|yes but on the side.
PS065|Oh there you mean not at the bottom at the side.
PS066|Where I've just dug.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Where I've just dug there And I said I'd put sweetpeas.
PS065|Mm Mm Yeah.
PS066|I was wondering whether to put some fuchsia Because I've got some fu.
PS065|Haven't we got some towards this end Perhaps.
PS066|Yes we've got got s I've got loads in in flowerpot in these big containers And I.
PS065|Oh I see.
PS066|I'm just stumped where to put them.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|I don't want to keep them in containers.
PS065|If it's an evergreen no it's not is it.
PS066|Fuchsia.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|No.
PS065|No Mm.
PS066|No they die down.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|Most of the ones that we brought seem to have erm.
PS065|Survived.
PS066|Survived Which I'm glad.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|Because we've got some nice ones And then those that Karen brought us they were nice.
PS065|Yes Yeah.
PS066|Got some lovely ones.
PS065|Mhm.
PS066|Well I thought they'd be protected by the fence.
PS065|Yeah Mm.
PS066|Wouldn't have much room for sweetpeas though would I I don't know though they'd grow up behind wouldn't they.
PS065|Yes Course they will yeah Mm.
PS066|The only problem being cutting the hedge.
PS065|Pardon.
PS066|The only problem being cutting the hedge.
PS065|Cutting the hedge.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Oh yeah.
PS066|But.
PS065|But how often do you have to cut that sort of hedge then.
PS066|Not a lot.
PS065|Not like a privet Mm.
PS066|if I can find erm I can't I remember Carolyn bringing that you know that little er the anemone.
PS065|No.
PS066|And we didn't know what it was.
PS065|Er all I can remember a lot of plants coming.
PS066|Yes well.
PS065|But I can't remember.
PS066|I remember that in a little pot down there and you know they were labelled She put the labels on.
PS065|Oh yes she did a label mhm.
PS066|Well I'm sure I remember the anemone blander.
PS065|Mm I don't know Oh I see.
PS066|And I think I planted it.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|and it nothing s it didn't seem to survive.
PS065|Mhm.
PS066|And I was reading about the conditions Maybe with erm erm putting fertiliser on them you know.
PS065|Mhm Mm.
PS066|erm.
PS065|Mhm.
PS066|I think it and it's come up.
PS065|Ah.
PS065|Well good o.
PS066|It looks quite pretty now but it could be quite.
PS065|Well.
PS066|Yeah true.
PS065|Mm I've come across a bit of architrave by the way Quite apart from.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|Erm So I can use that as an experimental piece.
PS066|Where.
PS065|there's stuff come to think of it it's the one in the hall The doorway that's bricked up Yeah.
PS066|Oh of course I keep forgetting there was a doorway there when we arrived.
PS065|Yeah That's right the architrave from there.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|Erm it's exactly the same varnish stain as this.
PS066|Is it.
PS065|So I can muck about on that piece before I tackle it in here so mm stripping goes.
PS066|Oh I see what you mean To to er see.
PS065|Without staining without what.
PS066|Mm that's true To see if w what colour we can get that we like instead of this.
PS065|Yeah Yeah That's right.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|First of all what's the best stripping medium Whether it's gon na be gentle heat whether it's gon na be varnish stripper Paint stripper What the hell And then see the go on.
PS066|Er w do you have to strip it.
PS065|If we want to change the colour Unless we're going to use a varnish stain as such But it's very and it looks a bit crummy that stuff I always think.
PS066|Ooh Ooh well I don't know.
PS065|Mm See look at.
PS066|It's a big area.
PS065|Pardon.
PS066|It's a big area to strip Why wouldn't it.
PS065|Well it's only what erm the architrave the arch there this side that side and that one there.
PS066|Well I mean if you had it sort of darker wouldn't it stain darker slightly.
PS065|Well as I say you can't stain varnished wood Nina.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|You can put a varnish stain on Varnish stain but erm In in this particular light now I can see where they've put on thick blodges that run down.
PS066|I know it's terrible isn't it.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|I wouldn't think that was a professional job.
PS065|Oh what was I don't think.
PS066|But well originally what would they have done with it When it was built.
PS065|Oh no I don't think I don't think it's from square one It probably would be varnished from square one but that's not the original varnish.
PS066|No.
PS065|Shouldn't think no.
PS065|I doubt it very much indeed.
PS066|shocking colour isn't it.
PS065|Yes it is And do you know the old bog door it's the same colour as next door's Or was I should say.
PS066|Was it.
PS065|The same yucky blue yeah.
PS066|Was it.
PS065|Mm So if you look at the next time you're in the loo.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|where the handle was look where the blue shows And that's that was the original colour.
PS066|That w do you think that's what they did originally.
PS065|Yeah The original colour yeah.
PS066|Mm when it was built.
PS065|Mm Mm Mm Mm.
PS066|blue didn't they.
PS065|It might of course have been a more acceptable blue when it was put on because it changes.
PS066|Do you remember that er flat that Lil and Nev er went into.
PS065|Oh goodness.
PS066|Before they.
PS065|Oh down here.
PS066|No.
PS065|Where.
PS066|They've not been in a flat.
PS065|Oh Prestwych.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|Well when yes where they rented when they sold theirs.
PS065|Yeah yeah.
PS066|and were waiting for their other house up here to be finished.
PS065|Paid a fortune for the damn Yeah.
PS066|Well that was all blue do you remember.
PS065|No I only remember one.
PS066|Because when I when I went to see Lil.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|er spent the day with her.
PS065|Yeah yeah.
PS066|and I hadn't seen the flat before and the first thing she said to me wherever you look in here it's blue And it was too.
PS065|Was it really.
PS066|Yes Er it.
PS065|Well how do you mean The paintwork was blue.
PS066|Everything yes Paint decorations everything.
PS065|What.
PS066|Well n.
PS066|not every not every exactly everything but.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|as you got went into the flat you got an overall picture of blue.
PS065|Mm Mm Mm.
PS066|Everywhere you looked was blue.
PS066|I find blue a depressing colour even though I like blue I mean I.
PS065|Well it's isn't it Blue for depression and red for excitement and.
PS066|Yes but.
PS065|What's a calming colour.
PS066|For a decoration in a home I don't like blue.
PS065|No no.
PS066|And yet young Nicky's gone for blue Blue.
PS065|Well it's a change from black that.
PS066|Well yes they've got the black furniture you know.
PS065|They've got the furniture of course yes That's true.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|Some of it looks nice but I wouldn't like.
PS065|Well it'll die the death eventually won't it I mean the stripped pine really horrible.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Isn't it.
PS066|Yes well I think I think it's overdone.
PS065|Course it's overdone.
PS066|I like a bit but.
PS065|It's blooming cheap half of it It is cheap Er no it isn't cheap.
PS066|cheap.
PS065|God no.
PS066|I wouldn't say that.
PS065|Cheaper than.
PS066|It's a bit glaring to me I find it so it's not as mellow as I like.
PS065|No it's not It's usually crummy wood Badly assembled.
PS066|Well it depends how much you're going to pay for your furniture doesn't it really.
PS065|Well I mean the one that er that er thing what is it.
PS066|They paid a lot for that didn't they.
PS065|It's it's rubbish that thing.
PS066|Is it.
PS065|It's rubbish Absolute rubbish It really is cos.
PS066|Mm I'm not struck on.
PS065|they moved it out when we went on one occasion cos was the carpet wet or something I don't know They moved it out for something reason so I had occasion to look at it more closely.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|I thought I was looking at it before I thought mm Anyway it drew my attention to it and I thought god god Mm it might be fashionable but phoo Incidentally I wasn't far out with th the age of our friend across the road was I.
PS066|No No.
PS065|Twenty four I thought he was about that Mm Bit like Eric's place in a way.
PS066|Oh never Wonder how he is.
PS065|Mm well no Not in that se pardon.

PS066|and whether he's still going.
PS065|Oh probably yeah.
PS066|Probably.
PS065|Floating with his beer every afternoon yeah.
PS066|He's a funny old stick wasn't he.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|Wonder whether he got anywhere with the Seemed to make a beeline for his place didn't they.
PS065|Mm Most probably he got waffling on in the Royal Oak and that.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Gave the impression I think Mm I can't see our friend er what was his name The chap that bought our house.
PS066|Oh god.

PS066|Mm.
PS065|Erm I can't see him him getting very chummy with Eric can you.

PS066|Oh that's going back a bit isn't it.
PS065|I know yes Oh yes.
PS066|He didn't see his auntie as well then.
PS065|No I don't think so I don't know I'm sure but he never mentioned it anyway.
PS066|I don't remem erm his I don't remember his mother Only.
PS065|I've got a very hazy but I could be confusing it her with one of the other relatives.
PS066|I think she was ill when.
PS065|Was she short dumpy podgy sort of thing and.
PS066|Well no I don't know I don't remember.
PS065|Oh I neither do I.

PS066|Well we thought they had last time we went Do you remember.
PS065|Oh yes I vaguely remember that but I whether they'd actually moved or not I don't know.

PS065|Mm.
PS066|Oh what an upheaval.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|I don't know how people can move from one place to another Do the place up then.
PS065|Well.
PS066|move over to another place Oh heck no thank you.
PS065|it depends on a lot of factors really doesn't it.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Or a lot of factors come into it Age group finances.
PS065|desire to move for a variety of reasons erm permanently regarded house in the first place you know.
PS066|Mm I mean like in Jill's case Jill and Steve.
PS065|Yes that always struck me as a bit odd yes.
PS066|I it's a big upheaval every few years isn't it.
PS065|Yeah Mm Mm.
PS066|to have to do it with your job.
PS065|Yeah Mm.
PS066|And it's worse when you've got children to cope with as well.
PS065|That and the obvious school problem too with the kids yeah.
PS066|Mm I don't think it's good for them moving them about from school to school do you.
PS065|No it can't be Well I don't know about that I mean with some schools it'd be a good idea to get them away from it.
PS066|Well.
PS065|And some areas in fact I mean really desirable to move away from there wasn't it.
PS066|Er well that's true.
PS065|Mm And privately it would be no bad thing to move away from where they are now I mean well they're gon na have problems wherever they go but the on erm a different estate different type of estate they wouldn't have as many problems would they.
PS066|Mm I don't know so much.
PS065|I don't think so Not as many.
PS066|I've found out how to get rid of the cat scratching.
PS065|No another idea What is it this time.
PS066|No it's not my idea Apparently you can get.
PS065|No no.
PS066|pellets of er lion dung.
PS065|Oh I yes Don't you remember erm.
PS066|Oh dear.
PS065|somebody on Gardener's Question Time answering that.
PS066|I didn't know you could get it in pellets.
PS065|Well either did I but.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|Although although inoffensive to people cats dislike the scent and avoid.
PS065|For obvious reasons yeah.
PS066|Mm We'll try that.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|Materials cause no ill effects to plants soil or your own pets.
PS065|Mm How much er.
PS066|It doesn't say.
PS065|lions obviously well.
PS066|Oh hang on yes it does The lion dung.
PS066|pellets come in a handy sealed plastic bag inside a box with instruction.
PS066|One kilogram contents are enough for about thr thirty metres square.
PS065|Good god.
PS066|square metres I know and will last for roughly three months in average weather Oh gee whiz.
PS066|Be a bit potent.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Price per bag is eight pound oh it's eight eight pound ninety nine.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS065|Open container with care And stand back No it would it wouldn't necessarily pong.
PS066|No it says it it it's inoffensive to people.
PS065|Mm mm mm You can take it two ways it'll probably get up and bite you.
PS066|I'm still looking for me broom.
PS065|Was it broom.
PS066|Yes I think.
PS065|Oh yes yes.
PS066|I'm sure it was in here somewhere.
PS065|The name of that particular species is in there though What do you want.
PS066|Er.
PS065|The colour or something.
PS066|Can't remember what it said underneath it.
PS065|Well er won't it be in the other one catalogue.
PS066|Yeah I think it was in this one.
PS065|I seem to remember looking at it in the other one.
PS066|I forgot we sent for erm.
PS065|Oh yes your free giftie.
PS066|free gifts Mm.
PS065|Oh yes It'll arrive no doubt.
PS066|ago since we sent it Oh it's not long is it.
PS065|Not for that sort of er thing no They're certainly not quick And they probably haven't if they get five hundred certain number and five hundred thousand you know.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|It's not worth looking on the box for the news because it's they'll be nothing new.
PS066|I can't find it.
PS065|Mm Mm no doubt you will eventually.
PS066|These rolled houses are they.
PS065|these.
PS066|Rolled what they call a rolled house.
PS065|What on earth is a rolled house.
PS066|It's a kind of a a type of mini greenhouse greenhouses and frames er the prices.
PS065|Oh no no.
PS066|It takes your breath away A tiny little thing of the size of a tomato house.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|Fifty pounds.
PS065|Well it's a bit like these victorian wheelbarrows and things aren't they Yeah solid How much were they About seventy five quid or something stupid like that They're not as good as the Lot of weight in themself Bound to go rotten eventually Mm Well they're trendy so I suppose it's the usual afternoon run to Leo's is it.
PS066|Pardon.
PS065|Usual afternoon run to Leo's.
PS066|Oh yes.
PS065|Yeah I suppose we want Mm Am I not supposed to be going somewhere tomorrow to to enquire about something or.
PS066|Oh I know what I meant to ask you When we go erm.
PS065|Ah.
PS066|no er we haven't said anything about it before I only.
PS065|Oh.
PS066|thought about it when I was reading the property thing it might be er while I'm in Leo's.
PS065|Oh yes The estate agents Mm.
PS065|Yes I think their office is near the erm near Iceland Think that's it.
PS066|And there's two houses here oh i it might be an idea although I wouldn't mind going in and having a look.
PS065|Yeah You can have a look.
PS066|But usually by the time I come out of Leo's I'm dying to get home.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|W well let's get off er early soon as we can.
PS065|We always do though Don't we.
PS066|Mm What time is it.

PS066|Yeah Oh er it didn't register.
PS066|Well there's these two here There could be some more And it'll soften the blow.
PS065|There's no there's no price on there I presume.
PS066|No that's just the thing.
PS065|Ooh.
PS066|It's a stupid habit not putting the price on People must lose sales for that.
PS065|Well it's possibly at the request of the vendor you know.
PS066|I know they do But what I'm saying is people.
PS065|Oh yeah I know.
PS066|a lot of people if they're alright if you want it you're interested and you're interested you'll find out Fair do's.
PS065|Course you will.
PS066|but not everybody will bother like that.
PS065|Oh no no no.
PS066|You do tend to skip by if there's another one that you think oh well.
PS065|Course you will Mm.
PS066|I I I'm.
PS065|Oh I won't bother with that cos that'll be too expensive or whatever yeah Oh quite mm.
PS066|Er yeah I think.
