PS065|It's not too bad finding where you want to go.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|when it comes to looking for or path lab or whatever it is but finding your way out Very seldom they have continuing er continuity of markers saying exit you know or this way out.
PS066|Wouldn't it it's stupid that.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|isn't it You can't get out quick enough can you usually.
PS065|Not short on the emergency exit signs but yeah exactly Mm I mean once you've got in But once you've gone down and turned left then turned right and gone ahead.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|It's like a labyrinth you know.
PS066|I know Certainly if you've not been before.
PS065|Mm Mm Exactly I asked somebody the way out and she offered to show me Mm.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|Oh yeah cleaner mm.
PS066|Well Carolyn when Carolyn was working at Witham Withamshaw.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|she said it was very lonely at night when you were walking down the corridors.
PS065|Yes I remember you saying Oh it would be of course yeah Mm oh it would be It's quite a it seems at least quite a pleasant hospital Quite a pleasant atmosphere.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|I shouldn't imagine they have the problems that they do at erm Withamshaw and.
PS065|oh no they won't of course Oh no.
PS066|And do you remember the.
PS065|What.
PS066|when Carolyn was working there they had this intruder.
PS065|Well they're often having intruders go on.
PS066|I can't remember all the details There was quite a about it in the paper.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|I I know Carolyn said that they in the end.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|they refused to work on their own.
PS065|Oh that's right I remember Yes yes Yeah.
PS066|because they were so way out There was no way.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|that they could have summoned help or anything else.
PS065|Mm Mm And di didn't she have to leave.
PS066|Pardon.
PS065|Didn't she ha well to get from A to B didn't she have to leave the building somewhere.
PS066|Yes Yeah.
PS065|Yeah I thought so Mm They're not too bad here but at Witham Withamshaw it'd be a different kettle of fish altogether.
PS066|Er yes.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|Mm because do you remember when we had to go and collect her That night.
PS065|Yeah Erm hang on.
PS066|It was very there's some very lonely lanes there.
PS065|I remember going late at night Were we collecting her.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Were we really Mm.
PS066|she was in the flat.
PS066|And she'd passed out in the phone box.
PS065|I remember that happening but.
PS066|And that's when we went to collect her there.
PS065|And that was Withamshaw.
PS066|That was Withamshaw yeah.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Er sh yes they were in er where were they living The flat then they weren't they didn't have the house.
PS065|Mm Mm You said.
PS066|And she'd only just gone to the end of the road to phone Ken was working away.
PS065|Oh yes that's right Mm.
PS066|Wasn't he.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|And Nicky wanted to it was only a cock's stride down the road Andrew was in bed and she just whipped out so Nicky could say goodnight to her daddy.
PS065|Oh yes that's right Mm.
PS066|Oh dear What a performance.
PS065|Mm Yes you get so used to having a phone at home don't you.
PS066|Mm It's very handy Having to go to the end of the road well it's daft now That's if you can find one working.
PS065|Not too bad here from what I've seen.
PS066|No.
PS065|No.
PS066|No but I mean in Manchester it was shocking wasn't it.
PS065|Oh well It was a very pleasant surprise if there is one working Mm.
PS066|You know I was just thinking.
PS065|Were you Jolly good.
PS066|That well Lil and Nev going up on the mini break.
PS065|W tomorrow is it they go.
PS066|Yeah Wednesday to Saturday yes.
PS065|Mm go on.
PS066|I'll bet they hear of these mini breaks through the wh I can't remember.
PS065|She probably.
PS066|her name.
PS065|Was it Carol No it's not Carol.
PS066|No No it's.
PS065|I don't know what her name is but I know the one you mean The travel agency girl.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Young woman yeah.
PS066|I wouldn't be surprised.
PS065|Probably Mm Mm I'm wondering what made them change their mind over the er knock through into the garage.
PS066|Well I suppose they thought it was a bit too much I mean the place they've got there it er it would mean.
PS065|Oh I'm not sugge.
PS066|that them decorating.
PS065|I know.
PS066|the whole lot again wouldn't it.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Oh no way.
PS065|Yes but surely they thought that through before they got to the stage that I mean even with the mortgage.
PS066|Well that's probably why they've decided against it.
PS065|No Before they got to the stage of asking for quotes because Nev had moved all his tools and tackle and stuff to clear it.
PS066|Had they actu actu really had a quote.
PS065|I don't know I really don't know.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|They were due to get one Any time.
PS066|They might have had one and found out what it was going to cost and were decided against.
PS065|Possibly.
PS066|They're having a mini break instead.
PS065|Oh possibly again i it's just possible actually that the construction of the bungalow didn't lend itself properly well to knocking through.
PS066|Well I think oh well it's so beautiful I mean as it is in there they don't need anything doing to I mean.
PS065|Well.
PS066|they've got it nice They've got it so they don't get s sort of minimum you know.
PS065|Labour.
PS066|Yes So I shouldn't imagine that erm I mean once we've got through this one I'm blowed if I'm going to do it.
PS066|just for the sake of doing it It'll have to really need it before we start again.
PS065|Well mm Oh yeah I know But they they are a little bit inclined to what shall we spend some money on next aren't they.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Well if it's there fair do.
PS065|Oh Fair do I know but er it's up to them what they do with their money I know but mm.
PS066|What's happened to the rest of the paper Larry There's only half of it there.
PS065|Well which paper.
PS066|The Telegraph Last week's Telegraph There's only one.
PS065|I haven't the faintest idea.
PS066|sheet there Just one.
PS065|One sheet.
PS066|Well one section.
PS065|Oh I don't know I haven't the faintest idea.
PS066|It's just disappeared.
PS065|I haven't moved it at all Not knowingly anyway No It's possible I've used it but I don't erm don't recall Never had an occasion to use well the only time I've used a newspaper as far as I know this afternoon when I emptied the bag And that was.
PS066|Because we were going to phone up.
PS065|Yeah I know.
PS066|the piece at with the.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|housing in.
PS065|Yes for the er.
PS066|We were going to phone up and that seems to have.
PS065|the two bungalows yeah Mm It is incidentally It's where I thought it was.
PS066|Is it.
PS065|On the left hand side and erm it's pretty near the main road.
PS066|Mm Oh I know where you mean.
PS065|Oh you do.
PS066|I think I do anyway.
PS065|The area.
PS066|Mm I thought it was on the main road.
PS065|It is on the main road.
PS066|Oh I see what you mean the front's pretty near the main road Would that bother them do you think being so close to the main.
PS065|I don't know Nina I haven't the faintest idea.
PS066|Cos it looks quite a decent reasonable bungalow I wonder how much they want for it.
PS065|I d I could only glanced at it as I drove past cos the traffic was moving fairly quickly for the lights there you know But.
PS066|Mm I bet the layout's something similar to that one we saw further.
PS065|Probably There's not much of a difference between.
PS066|No it looks the same shape somehow doesn't it.
PS065|No Mm yeah yeah fairly tight.
PS066|But that they're the one that.
PS065|Sorry go on.
PS066|we went to er look at four of them in the middle of er the three.
PS065|Oh yeah Where Whereabouts was that.
PS066|There was four four it was in the middle The girl that works at the garage sh next door to that.
PS065|Oh not a bungalow a house you mean Sorry yeah.
PS066|A house Well that one I mean everybody said oh that's too near to the main road so if that was too near to the main road so will this one be.
PS065|Well did Carolyn say that I can't remember.
PS066|No Dawn said Neither can I.
PS065|Well Dawn thought it was I certainly thought it was But then.
PS066|I know I didn't.
PS065|I don't like traffic noise.
PS066|It w yes it I'd it wouldn't have bothered me that.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|But it I can quite see that it would bother some people.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|But it's not as if it's a main road like.
PS065|Oh crikey no.
PS066|in Manchester is it.
PS065|Oh no No.
PS066|There you could complain but I I wouldn't say you get that much traffic at night.
PS065|Mm Mm Certainly not at night you won't get a lot no Erm.
PS066|Well you wouldn't notice during the day You don't notice the same It's when everywhere's quiet And you're trying to sleep.
PS065|Yes but it's noises you don't notice if they're continuous then they become.
PS066|That's right True.
PS065|Yeah Mm.
PS066|Still.
PS065|I mean that's one of the beauties here wasn't it It's so peaceful so quiet.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|There's no noises to get used to really.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Apart from the birds and the bees and the.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|sycamore trees.
PS066|And Sambo.
PS065|And Sambo flying around yeah No he just crawled under the door sort of glare glare at me and then scootled shooted past you know.
PS066|Why.
PS065|Shot I should say.
PS066|Shooted past.
PS065|Shooted past He shooted past as well as shot past Mm.
PS066|I wonder why.
PS065|I don't know because he he's never really been frightfully keen on me that cat.
PS066|Maybe it's probably has a rough working idea it's you that put the fountain on today.
PS065|I doubt that very much indeed Get on No No No I try to him but you know but er.
PS066|He's lovely.
PS065|He's alright He let me sort of tickle him and god knows what but er he's pretty wary for some reason It may well be of course that father was a bit er all dog and no cat sort of person you know I du n no.
PS066|Mm The they're both they're all in lovely condition aren't they Beautifully cared for.
PS065|Oh yes No argument about that yes Good nick.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|and well fed and.
PS066|Yes.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Mm Now we've decided not to do that little built up wall affair at the front.
PS065|Hang on Oh there yes Yeah.
PS066|it erm we won't need to be bothered quite so much about getting paving stones Or stones suitable stones to build will we.
PS065|Well we won't be needing so many that's for sure no I want some for the erection at the side of the pool there.
PS066|What Oh there.
PS065|To take the waterfall Mm It's only got ta match the existing er.
PS066|Well how many do you want I mean don't you want to put it on bricks.
PS065|Not bricks as such no.
PS066|just.
PS065|Cut some of the paving stones.
PS066|I see.
PS065|to roughly brick size.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|and use that As I have done with that erm.
PS066|Well how many will you need.
PS065|collection Pardon.
PS066|You won't need that many for there.
PS065|Not no no no no no Not an awful lot no I can pad out with sto with er brick where it doesn't show It'd look a bit odd with bricks though I think.
PS066|Mm True.
PS065|Oh yeah And then we want matching slabs really don't we.
PS066|Yes That'd be nice actu to have erm something you could sit on there.
PS065|Mm Wonder what do they do with old gravestones when they've er.
PS066|Ooh I hate to think.
PS065|when they've abandoned the graveyard.
PS066|Well they seem to be there for er you know when they did all that erm levelling at erm Southam Southam cemetery.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|I wonder what they did with them then They just flattened it didn't they and and It's a bit much when you come.
PS065|Yes they made it so it could be.
PS066|to think of somebody paying a fortune for a.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|gravestone and then they come along and flatten it.
PS065|Oh there must have been some sort of arrangement I don't know To to cope with that though.
PS066|Well quite a few of them.
PS065|Well bear in mind a lot of them were very old ones and there are.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|probably no nearest and dearest left surviving.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|True.
PS065|I seem to remember papers about that Erm that removal or disposal or alteration of the any creation around the grave was erm can be done at the discretion of of the.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|parks authority or whatever it is yeah.
PS066|It was better really when they'd done it.
PS065|Parks and cemeteries yeah.
PS066|wasn't it It was much neater.
PS065|Oh yes Both in far more pleasant to the eye.
PS066|Oh yes.
PS065|far neater and er oh yeah They can get more bodies in too.
PS066|Ooh.
PS066|Shall we change the subject.
PS065|No I ha No I just had a thought because there must be stacks of old grave gravestones around Some of the marble they cracking cracking bit of yeah I know.
PS066|No they yes they are.
PS065|Should be for the price they charge too Ridiculous forking out a fortune.
PS066|I wonder how many I wonder how many people have now got them as hearths Now this marble er this kind of marble hearths.
PS065|Yes you've got yeah Yeah that's a point That's a point.
PS066|I don't like that thing we've got there.
PS065|I think they're rather thicker than that the damaged gravestone.
PS065|Mm When you think of all the Go on.
PS066|Mind you it it's indestructible really isn't it.
PS065|Oh.
PS066|Once you've got it down.
PS065|I wouldn't say indestructible but I know what you mean yeah Yeah Yeah very very longlasting yeah Depends on the quality of the marble too doesn't it.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|Obviously No I was gon na say when you think of all the money that's spent with these very elaborate er headstones erm creations showing angels looking down on them plonking at their harps and god knows what They look quite nice from one point of view but er fifty seventy eighty hundred years later what the hell does it matter You know.
PS066|Mhm well I suppose it does to some people We've got to decide what to do at our fireplace yet haven't we Ooh what a problem.
PS065|Well if we get some headstones it'll be different.
PS066|If you know if you pardon If you take.
PS065|Cor.
PS066|the top off the wooden part.
PS065|Er yes The mantelpiece.
PS066|Yes.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|Do you think it'll it's sort of cut so that the er it fits on top of the brickwork.
PS065|That one is I'm pretty sure yes Yeah.
PS066|Do you think it'll look still look the brickwork.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|Mm Mind you it won't matter if we erm will it.
PS065|Oh no that will.
PS066|Fancy building I mean that must have been done when when the house was built.
PS065|No No no it's not original that No.
PS066|the original one then.
PS065|You can see where the original fire surround was.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|Look at the plaster work there behind it above it Mm And where's the hearth different hearth isn't it.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Yes that's right.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|I'll be glad when that's done It's going to be a big job really.
PS065|Mm No I should imagine it's a typical sixties late sixties erm well early sixties er tile surround you know.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|It's not.
PS066|When you look there's there's really there's only this room.
PS065|Go on.
PS066|to remove the paper.
PS065|Erm.
PS066|Er the the the two rooms like the big room and the bathroom.
PS065|And our bedroom.
PS066|Oh there's not much to move in.
PS065|There's in there no.
PS066|in the be because I think.
PS065|Not no.
PS066|the paper that's in the wardrobe alcoves.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|Well if that's firm it'll erm be washing over there won't it.
PS065|Lick over Oh yes Yes it's good enough there.
PS066|Well there's only the little bit on the breast of the er the chimney breast type of thing.
PS065|There's between the two yeah yeah.
PS066|that needs removing.
PS065|Mm Mm Mm.
PS066|And that was that came off quite easily on the other wall.
PS065|Yeah Mm.
PS066|There's not that much to do so this is the main one really And the bathroom Mm.
PS065|For wallpaper removal Oh yes I need to see how those steamers work how well they work.
PS066|Well they must work fairly well because erm.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|well Joan and Clive were saying they did them.
PS065|Yes and Derek remember next door.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|And Terry he said He hadn't used one before and he was a bit cackhanded.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|So they must have been pretty good.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm Nice just to.
PS066|Carolyn was saying that a friend of theirs down the road she hired one.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|and finish she didn't know where to stop And she it was so quick Yes it was very efficient.
PS065|You mean it was working so quick and easy Yes Yeah Yeah.
PS066|And erm she was very impressed.
PS065|Oh Do you remember the old days when it was standard practice to put one paper on top of another.
PS066|Ooh How many pa.
PS065|With the overlap.
PS066|I know How many papers did we move.
PS065|You know.
PS066|off the er.
PS065|Oh god I don't know.
PS066|the old Oh about seven Oh dear.
PS065|Yes Yes it probably was Yeah Mm.
PS066|What a job It was a heck of a long way up there as well wasn't it.
PS065|Yeah But do you remember the borders The edges I should say at the at the roll.
PS066|Mm Yes I do.
PS065|They used to have little marks to line the paper up when you hang it.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|Yeah Down the.
PS066|Can't remember that.
PS065|Exactly Down the edge.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|the name of the manufacturer and possibly the say the model like the that particular paper's erm category name But it had at about oh eighteen inch intervals something like that Little marks sometimes an arrow sticking out When you when you put the next roll on you married up the arrow.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|Yeah Mm.
PS066|I remember cutting out when you used to have to cut all down your rolls of wallpaper.
PS065|That's right.
PS066|And do you remember when you had to cut all your borders out.
PS065|Yeah but don't you remember when they had that erm erm edge on it And you knocked it on the edge of a table.
PS066|Oh yes.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Things have changed a bit.
PS065|Yes I don't quite know why they put that edge on in the first place.
PS066|No.
PS065|Unless it was in those days they didn't have the shrink wrap stuff did they.
PS066|I think they used to overlap them one edge didn't they.
PS065|Oh didn't th I was just thinking yeah.
PS066|That's right.
PS065|Oh it was standard to yeah a standard practice job that yeah.
PS066|To overlap Well you could always see the join.
PS065|Oh yes of course.
PS066|And the joins they've put on this wallpaper here they stand out.
PS065|Oh god.
PS066|about a mile don't they.
PS065|Well this particular paper you you've got to be very care.
PS066|I don't like it.
PS065|otherwise it crushes very easily.
PS066|Mm I don't like it.
PS065|Mm No It's not my favourite by any means.
PS066|We'll have to go and be having a look at at erm.
PS065|What.
PS066|choose a paper for the room where we're doing now.
PS065|Yes there's a bit more plastering to be done yet.
PS066|Not a lot though is there.
PS065|Not a lot no I want to skim that corner ceiling and the top of the wall Erm.
PS066|And strip all the little.
PS065|and there's also there's a usual crack between the plasterboard and ceiling over the door and a little crack running down to the door.
PS066|Is there.
PS065|yeah It's worth doing.
PS066|Oh yes.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|And do it properly Well.
PS065|Mm Oh yes And there's all the burning off and mm And also I want to while the carpet's up investigate the run of the cable So it's.
PS066|And have you any idea yet.
PS065|About.
PS066|Where the cable runs.
PS065|Yes Yeah yeah I think it's a spur coming off that runs into the er But I don't think it's a proper imme immersion heater circuit.
PS066|You're joking.
PS065|Well it doesn't have to be.
PS066|Should it be Oh.
PS065|No it doesn't have to be No no no No No.
PS066|There's a a mark on the wall you know where the switch is where you switch the pump on and off.
PS065|Er yes.
PS066|Well there's a mark on the wall Something's been on the wall that was round.
PS065|Yes That would be erm the junction box Mm.
PS066|Why would they need another junction box there then Cos there's one down at the bottom.
PS065|To feed I s would suspect the immersion heater Mm.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Well what have they taken it off for then Oh they wouldn't need they wouldn't mm.
PS065|Because y you when you have your cable up to the junction hang on up to your junction box.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|and from the junction box to the actual immersion heater itself.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|you have erm a heatproof cable called er systaflex I think it's called.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Yeah Er it's sort of a white braided stuff that goes over.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Heat resistant.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|So you'd need a junction box to erm connect the.
PS066|Well you know how they've you know where the pipe comes out of the cupboard.
PS065|Hang on There are a lot of pipes.
PS066|No the the pipe that I w I think supposedly leads to the radiator.
PS065|Erm.
PS066|And it comes down under that little.
PS065|do you mean the one with the pump in.
PS066|Yes.
PS065|Oh that pipe Yeah yeah.
PS066|By the wall and it.
PS065|Oh.
PS066|comes into that little erm ooh the sort of semi skirting board thing.
PS065|Erm.
PS066|That stands away from the wall.
PS065|offhand I can't say yes I do but.
PS066|Well it it's flat and then it comes down You've got your skirting board.
PS065|Flat and then it comes down.
PS066|It houses pipes And it's.
PS065|Oh you you mean in the room.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|Yes but I mean which pipe you mean no.
PS066|Well I don't know the pipe I haven't seen the pipe have I.
PS065|Oh it's in the oh sorry go on Carry on.
PS066|No This thing but er er the pipe comes from the cupboard You can see it.
PS065|If there's a pipe or pipes cupboard yeah.
PS066|I du n no but it you can see it coming through.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|and it into that housing.
PS065|Yeah Yeah.
PS066|and then it comes right round to the radiator.
PS065|Yes I know yeah.
PS066|and goes right to that wall doesn't it.
PS065|Yes Yeah yeah Yeah Yeah.
PS066|Well why would it need if that if it does that when it gets to the radiator.
PS065|Oh it's not just for the radiator.
PS066|Oh I see.
PS065|It's the hot water to the tap in the kitchen.
PS066|Oh I see.
PS065|That's right yeah.
PS066|As well Well what I was looking at this afternoon was your radiator comes through the floor And yet all these pipes are here Why isn't why wouldn't they take erm your radiator pipe the water the pipe that feeds the radiator.
