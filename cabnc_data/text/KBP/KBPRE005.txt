PS066|The only thing I only I don't know all the names of some of the people.
PS065|Oh I wouldn't know any of them.
PS066|But apart from that it's not a very difficult one.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Let's have a look what's what.
PS065|Is it based on the contents of of rather the erm.
PS066|Yes It is.
PS065|people on the box.

PS065|Mm.
PS066|I'm quite capable of forgetting in about five minutes.
PS065|Mm Well it wouldn't take me that long.
PS066|Oh dear.
PS065|Quite a bit more today anyway.
PS066|Oh well yes.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|It's a hard slog isn't it I wish we'd got a bit further really but it's hard work.
PS065|There's a lot of work But we we're getting there slowly Mm.
PS066|Let's have a look and see what's what.
PS065|you see the doors are different quarter inch difference in size.
PS066|You wouldn't I wouldn't have thought that the same.
PS065|No it didn't surprise me cos they usually no they put the casing up the door casing.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|And then the chippie erm cuts the door to fit it you know Very seldom you get it a perfect fit when you.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|just it in Fortunately it is the right way round.
PS066|Mm I don't think they I would have thought that everything was more or less.
PS065|Well it is more or less.
PS066|spot on.
PS065|No No.
PS066|size When the houses were built at the same time and.
PS065|They possibly are today Erm a lot of stuff's factory er.
PS066|Is that the sort of job that er Ken would be doing.
PS065|On the building site yeah.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|Mm Yeah.
PS066|Mm Did you hear Josie was saying about er.
PS065|What.
PS066|He's busy on this building project now but he doesn't know after.
PS065|Oh she said a few days ago about some bungalow or something he's he's helping to build He he's a brickie isn't he Yes that's right.
PS066|Yes.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|Whereabouts.
PS065|I haven't the faintest idea.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|Not the faintest.
PS066|So it they he'll be worried if oh mind you er anything in the building trade is a bit iffy isn't it I can't see Ken.
PS065|yeah.
PS066|getting a a job really can you Certainly not now.
PS065|I'd have thought he's going to find it extremely difficult down here to find a job.
PS066|Because I don't.
PS065|Of any sort Never mind just in the building trade.
PS066|Yes I don't think he'll rush down But he's so used to being.
PS065|Well he's got all his mates And he er I don't think he's got the confidence to.
PS066|No I don't.
PS065|No.
PS066|And then again he's getting older I mean.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|it's more difficult as you get older.
PS065|See I did see there's that place erm erm oh it's going it's Tearscross direction Erm.
PS066|Erm.
PS065|they advert.
PS065|Well they advertise in the paper every week Advertise carpenters and joiners But.
PS066|The thing is er where he is now.
PS065|Mhm.
PS066|er when mind you he's been in his job for a while now.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|But I mean when the jobs have finished he's always.
PS065|Well he.
PS066|managed to get on to another one pretty well straight away.
PS065|See hang on no no no The job's been never finished never will be finished with the corporation on it It's amazing Specially there.
PS066|No but I mean I don't mean wh I don't mean where he's been working for the corporation I mean before when he's had these various jobs and they've finished and he's had you know the job's finished and they've had to go somewhere.
PS065|Oh the shopfitting and mm mm mm Mhm Mhm.
PS066|He's always been quick at picking another job up.
PS065|Oh to be fair to him yes he has He's been very quick at that.
PS066|But as you get older that's not so easy is it.
PS065|No precisely No No.
PS066|And he might not find it so easy here Cos there's so many more people in pretty much the same trade.
PS065|I would have thought so Yes I would have thought so.
PS066|Mm And it just isn't commonsense to commute.
PS065|No.
PS066|to Manchester is it.
PS065|Oh he'd never do it It's ridiculous.
PS066|Mind you the only thing that I was thinking of do you know when he was commuting.
PS065|Ah.
PS066|that firm he was working for.
PS065|Yeah can't.
PS066|to Sw was it Swansea.
PS065|It probably was Swansea area I think it was yeah.
PS066|Yes it was Swansea area.
PS065|Go on.
PS066|He seemed to like that although he did get fed up with it.
PS065|Ah yes but it was quite a different run you see Nina That was motorway nearly all the way.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|And he could do it in less time.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|It was a straight run There was no driving involved You just point the car in the right direction press the pedal and you're there.
PS066|It was still a long way.
PS065|It's a longish way but erm for Ken it's not quite the same as erm the A roads and B roads and.
PS066|No.
PS065|oh no.
PS066|No.
PS065|Cos he doesn't really like driving.
PS066|No he doesn't.
PS065|No.
PS066|And it is a bit of a tedious journey.
PS065|He'd never do Mike's job Well he'd never do Mike's job anyway but.
PS066|Oh no.
PS065|you know the driving side.
PS066|No but Mike enjoys it doesn't he.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|He covers a a rattling big area.
PS065|He's got a big area to cover Mike if you think about it.
PS066|He seems to enjoy the job doesn't he.
PS065|Seems to yes Mark you he wouldn't crack on if he didn't No he wouldn't say very much about.
PS066|Well no I don't suppose so.
PS065|No No.
PS066|But goi reading between the lines you can usually have a a rough working idea.
PS065|Oh yes he obviously likes it better than when he was at er at that erm what do they call themselves.
PS066|Oh I can't remember now Erm oh well you see.
PS065|Mm Oh a hi fi firm.
PS066|he doesn't l like being tied to the bench does he.
PS065|Oh no He'd sooner be out.
PS066|And I think I think he does his job well anyway.
PS065|I'm quite sure he does his job extremely well yeah.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|So all is well.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|It it's a sha I feel sorry for young married couples these days.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|It's very hard going isn't it.
PS065|Oh yes Mm Oh yes Well.
PS065|Go on.
PS066|Mm I was gon na say something I've forgotten.
PS066|As is my wont.
PS065|Well you usually mm.
PS066|Mm but I can't see I don't think Carolyn would have much difficulty.
PS065|Er no I d particularly in view of her experience.
PS066|Cos yeah.
PS065|I don't think she would.
PS066|Exactly.
PS065|Quite as much anyway.
PS066|No I don't.
PS065|She might have to wait a wee while but I think she'll get on yes.
PS066|I think so.
PS065|And possibilities for Carolyn.
PS066|Yes.
PS065|came now I don't we may be completely wrong But as far as this exchange business is concerned.

PS065|It's er moderately interesting so far yes.
PS066|Yes I wouldn't mind reading that.
PS065|No I thought you might That's one another reason I got it out from the library Erm it rabbits on quite a lot up to now.
PS066|Yeah.

PS066|How did he er y how did he first find out that he w he had this.
PS065|Well he that's why he wanders on a bit Erm keeps giving little bits erm It was when he was a child apparently he claims to have been aware of it you know Mm.
