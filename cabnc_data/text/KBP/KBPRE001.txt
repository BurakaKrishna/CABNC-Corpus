PS065|I can't see Mike and Robin making a cake can you.
PS066|No No but.
PS065|Not no no no Robin necessarily but just temperaments.
PS066|I don't know but well I remember going out shopping and when I came back you'd got.
PS065|Jill.
PS066|you'd gone out No they were they were all of them there.
PS065|Were they.
PS066|Nan and I were out shopping When we got back.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|it was christmas shopping I think.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Anyway you'd been out and bought one of those m packets of m cake mix.
PS065|Oh it would be ready mixed yes.
PS066|Well and they'd made little buns They were very nice really.
PS065|Oh it's a tribute to the.
PS066|The state of the kitchen wasn't.
PS065|Well that'll be a tribute to the manufacturer sure Mm well I rem.
PS066|And Robin and L and erm Carol doing that er cabbage cabbage.
PS065|Oh that revolting.
PS066|That was horrible.
PS065|That was terrible I remember Jill though I don't remember the mix but mm I don't know that I vaguely remember now yes but.
PS066|Oh they were all there.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|because we'd gone out I think it was the christmas shopping we were doing on our own.
PS065|Was it.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm Yes I've got a hazy recollection but Mm Jill'll remember But she was a lot younger surely Jill And she'd be a bit.
PS066|Oh she'd be young erm.
PS065|Younger than them I mean.
PS066|They weren't oh they were younger than Carol Caroline and erm Ken.
PS065|Mm mm mm Mm.
PS066|But then look at Chris He must have been interested in cooking mustn't he.
PS065|I don't Chris.
PS066|No I think the young fellows today are more because of course they go into the flats don't they.
PS065|Mm well that's true of course.
PS066|I remember when Mike and Robin went into their flats I spent quite a long time with them.
PS065|Yeah I know Mm Mm Mhm.
PS066|Showing them how to do simple dishes.
PS065|Mhm But erm quite frankly I can't see myself ever getting given the same sort of circumstances.
PS066|Well n no.
PS066|I can't either Knowing you I no it's laughable.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|Can't imagine you meeting me with a nice cooked dinner and a a cake made by yo your own fair.
PS065|No I.
PS066|with a candle on.
PS065|No Use a soldering iron or a blow lamp or something not.
PS066|Burnt toast.
PS065|Ah no it's not really burnt it's the way I like it though Must admit technically.
PS066|Well it used to smoke.
PS065|Well yes technically speaking I suppose it is burnt but well done I.
PS066|Well it doesn't taste very nice.
PS065|I can't agree cos I that's how I like it.
PS066|And the s Well you used to scrape some of it off because it was all over the.
PS065|Oh if it gets really charred I know but.
PS065|if it's really charred that's a bit.
PS065|Certain degree of grey blackness even but.
PS066|And howd' you get toast charred so that you've got to scrape it off but it isn't burnt Oh I.
PS065|Well leaving it that little bit too long you know.
PS065|Remember Ro Robin coming home I don't believe it burnt burnt toast from an electric toaster I don't know how he does it.
PS066|I don't know.
PS065|Mm Oh well Doesn't feel like Sunday does it.
PS066|No I've not seen any more sight of that heron.
PS065|No.
PS066|I don't I think it was just a flash in the pan.
PS065|I don't think well.
PS066|I don't think I'm certain there's not.
PS065|I think it's much to do about nothing quite honestly.
PS066|I do.
PS065|I mean it may well be that we have to resort to some sort of er.
PS066|Well I don't feel like having a plastic heron.
PS065|Well I mean how do all the rest of the pond they've not all got bloody herons plastic herons perched on the side have they.
PS066|No.
PS065|Plastic.
PS066|But you knowd' you remember me going round the corner and seeing that erm.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|pond with all those plastic ducks on.
PS065|Flipping ducks on it Yeah I know.
PS066|That might have been some deterrent of some description.
PS065|I don't think so somehow That was just.
PS066|but I'm n I'm certainly not having little plastic ducks.
PS065|Art nouveau.
PS066|and little gnomes about.
PS065|Mm That's interesting er that erm comment Steve made about the postcard And the bird of prey silhouette you know I can.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|believe that being rather effective.
PS066|Well actually I have read about the heron that er I think was it I'm not sure that.
PS065|What the plastic plastic heron.
PS066|Oh yes.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|No way.
PS065|Mm But that silhouette business that could work you know.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|I can see that working Birds of prey.
PS066|Well really when you think it's only the same way as er laying the hose amongst your flower beds For cats.
PS065|Oh the snake you mean Yeah.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm I've still to have that proved to me to be honest It's a damn great snake.
PS066|Well I have.
PS065|isn't it If you think about it.
PS066|Yes Well I think well you know when we used to leave ours across the the lawn there.
PS065|Mm yeah.
PS066|Well S.
PS065|Cat didn't bother.
PS066|Samba no he.
PS065|No.
PS066|Well he did a he did for a bit.
PS065|Are you sure.
PS066|Yes I've watched him sort of er warily.
PS065|Waiting.
PS066|walk round But then he got so used to it that he didn't bother.
PS065|Mm yeah That's what I mean It may if it's any effect at all it's very short lived I think.
PS066|Mm I don't think pepper's a very useful deterrent I've sprinkled loads of.
PS065|No.
PS066|pepper round.
PS065|One shower of rain and you've lost it anyway.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|I'd have thought Mm.
PS066|I think the only deterrent is putting netting or something over it but er.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|you can't put netting over your whole garden can you It's silly.
PS065|No no We'll have to watch that pond though leaves next year.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Well this year of course Mm.
PS066|Well I can't really see what you can do only have netting over that when the leaves start to fall.
PS065|Well yes I could be a little bit more erm atten attentive to the damn thing couldn't I We need to sca scrape quite a lot of that out but erm not all by any means See a certain percentage have blown in I think off the grass and if I had some sort of a.
PS066|I was just er yeah I was just gon na say that.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|I think our problem here is it gets so windy with being on the corner.
PS065|Mm Mm Yeah.
PS066|D' you want any more tea.
PS065|Oh yes please But I think mm mm.
PS066|That was a silly question wasn't it.
PS065|It was unnecessary wasn't it oh yes I'll want a bit of a hand then With the top window.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|I've left it with two screws holding it at the moment As we did painting the outside yeah.
PS066|Yes I it won't blow out though.
PS065|No not at all I'm gon na hold it while you take the two final screws out.
PS066|Oh I see.
PS065|Yeah Cos it's almost impossible to get at it.
PS066|It won't erm I think.
PS065|What.
PS066|once you've got the window done it won't be too bad will it.
PS065|You mean the whole frame.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|And the opening light.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|It won't be too bad will it.
PS066|Oh I mean what I mean is you've not.
PS065|Well there's not a tremendous amount of burning left There's only one skirting board and the pipe cover.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|The casing round the other cupboard.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|And that's it I think And possibly the edges of the cupboard doors I don't know.
PS066|Yes they're not very brilliant.
PS065|No Mm certainly want cleaning up I may end up taking them off completely though I think that may be easier to do rather than do them in situ you know.
PS066|Are you going to have a piece of cake.
PS065|Oh yeah.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|He's done this in two and then sandwiched them together.
PS065|What two cakes and put them together he's.
PS066|Yes Well I used to do that.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|It's quite good though.
PS065|Mm I'm trying to remember did they have any the kids.
PS066|Erm.
PS065|I know they cut some for them but.
PS066|It's a wonder Caroline didn't.
PS065|No.
PS066|She usually stuffs doesn't she.
PS065|Mm Well yes.
PS066|Mm.
PS066|Did Jill say what time Caroline's appointment was.
PS065|No Er well not to me she didn't.
PS066|No well She pro she might have done to me but I can't remember.
PS065|In the afternoon They seem very confident they'll be back in time don't they.
PS066|Twenty five to four to meet young.
PS065|Yeah Pick him up at twenty five to four.
PS066|There's a heck of a lot of burning off when you come to think of all the burning off of paint we're going to have to do.
PS065|Oh god I know You're telling me.
PS066|But then.
PS065|Where possible I'll sand down obviously but there's there.
PS066|Yes but usually.
PS065|won't be many places I'd have thought.
PS066|There isn't It's.
PS065|No.
PS066|Cos it's been piled on so.
PS065|Yeah I can't get over that screw in the woodwork.
PS066|I know.
PS065|Good god I've seen dust before but and bits of fluff and rag and stuff but I've never seen a bloody and a nail damn great screw.
PS066|Well it's the same as the the way they've papered the walls round They've just papered over things You know.
PS065|They've papered over I know I know Mm.
PS066|It wouldn't have been if they'd had any furniture in when we when we first got in I wouldn't have been surprised to see it painted round there as well.
PS065|Oh the you mean Oh aye.
PS066|mm.
PS065|Mm Mm No coming back to the I would prefer to keep it in natural wood if we can but.
PS066|Oh yeah.
PS065|all those splodges of white are putty.
PS066|Are they.
PS065|Mm Unfortunately.
PS066|And there's nothing at all you can cover them with.
PS065|Well except to take them out Scrape the bits of putty out and put some filler in that will accept stain.
PS066|I think that'd be better.
PS065|Mm But that's a fairly long job though.
PS066|Er yes but I mean it it it would be worth it.
PS065|Mm See it won't accept stain anyway with that varnish on.
PS066|Well I don't like this colour stain anyway.
PS065|Well I don't.
PS066|It's a nasty colour.
PS065|You can't burn that off though It's dust.
PS066|You couldn't.
PS065|What.
PS066|just give a dab of paint over A dark paint.
PS065|It'd stand out a mile wouldn't it.
PS066|Would it.
PS065|Well perhaps not as obviously.
PS066|Well if you did it with a small brush.
PS065|Well it would still stand out wouldn't it cos it's a different colour Mm Not as.
PS066|You don't.
PS065|not as obvious perhaps as the white but.
PS066|That's what I mean.
PS065|Mm Mm But I'll have to get rid of all that varnish before it'll take any other stain.
PS066|Mm See what it's like.
PS065|I what it's like when.
PS066|When you've got rid of the varnish.
PS065|Mm I may have to use varnish stripper Get a kind of varnish stripper for it.
PS066|Well it might be better than erm doing it any other way because.
PS065|I don't think it'll burn off.
PS066|No I'm thinking of the fumes.
PS065|After all the other fumes I don't think that'll matter.
PS066|After what.
PS065|After the fumes of the paintwork I don't think that'll.
PS066|Won't that be worse than.
PS065|No Not as bad as No no.
PS066|Oh Cos I remember when you did twenty seven.
PS065|Mm Ah well that was a varnish paint.
PS066|That was quite.
PS065|That was a varnish paint.
PS066|And that won't that'll just be stain.
PS065|Varnish No It is a stain varnish In other words varnish with a stain added to the varnish before you apply it.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|As opposed to staining the wood and then varnishing it with.
PS066|Oh I see.
PS065|relatively clear varnish.
PS066|Mm Once we've got those tiles off at the bottom there.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|well we might as well paint.
PS065|Well I think I mean they're very nice it would rather I'd prefer to it would be nice to have tile there to break it but not those damn things and they certainly won't come off and go back.
PS066|They're a bit messy aren't they.
PS065|Mm One two three four five six seven eight twenty four Two dozen Mm.
PS066|How many did we get in the pack.
PS065|The pack I don't know.
PS066|I think it was twenty five.
PS065|I really don't know Oh it varies the pack doesn't it.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Think it is twenty five actually pack anyway.
PS066|But erm finding the right tile.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|In any case you don't want them all the same do you I think we're better off just snapping it off Wonder what state the wall's in.
PS065|Doesn't really matter all that much I'd skim over the plaster anyway.
PS066|Mm Be a right mess won't it.
PS065|Mm It's highly probable I'll finish up skimming anyway.
PS066|Mm I was just thinking that.
PS065|mm.
PS066|I mean the way what have they done here.
PS065|Well what have they done anywhere Mm.
PS066|Well they ran short of tiles or they ha they wouldn't be bothered cutting I bet.
PS065|That's more likely the case Mm.
PS066|One two three four.
PS065|Twenty four.
PS066|five six seven eight.
PS065|Twenty four on this front face wasn't there.
PS066|Yes there was three more there.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|So that ma er in any case they'd of got some of it being the two colours.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|It looks quite effective.
PS065|Oh it's quite effective if it's done correctly yes As it is now it's bloody awful.
PS066|Have you had some cake.
PS065|Er no I'll give it a miss right now thankyou I'm a bit full from my sandwich No I I'll enjoy it more.
PS065|later on No no.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Cup of tea would go down like a bomb but.
PS066|you've not eaten it.
PS065|Possibly yes Mm Mhm I meant to ask oh.
PS065|Aha aha.
PS065|Pardon.
PS065|Right Right.
PS065|Pardon.
PS065|Er oh yes yes I have actually.
PS066|Let's put this cake back in its tin.
PS065|I'll have a cup of tea then bash on with my window then I think.
PS066|Well the sooner it's finished.
PS065|Well yes because it is at least dry today.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|But erm It's gon na make a hell of a racket sanding down afterwards you know.
PS066|Well it can't be helped.
PS065|No it can't be helped no I'll probably have to get some medium grade paper too Cos I've got a lot of gr fine and coarse but.
PS066|with us making a row won't they.
PS065|I can't think that all that much goes through you know to be honest Obviously.
PS066|Yeah well but by and large we've not.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|really been on their wall have we.
PS065|No that's what I mean.
PS066|When we start down here.
PS065|Some of the heavier banging and the the high pitch high frequency erm noises like me drill and erm.
PS066|Just keep it down to erm.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|a minimum keep.
PS065|Yeah yeah.
PS066|not do it late just keep stopping before it gets too late.
PS065|Well exactly what we have been doing.
PS066|Cos it is annoying isn't it you know.
PS065|Oh yeah.
PS066|But there's not an awful lot you can do is there I mean if we had a firm of workmen in they'd.
PS065|They'd still do yeah.
PS066|they'd make more noise wouldn't they.
PS065|Oh rather more noise yeah.
PS066|But erm.
PS065|And the clatter of tea cups.
PS065|But then I was meant to mention ask Rachel if she'd seen the photograph cos Mike didn't know about the two photographs that er Rachel and Louise have taken.
PS066|Mm Have I given yours has yours got sugar in.
PS065|I don't know.
PS065|I really don't know.
PS066|I'm not sure whether that has ha I can usually tell er I've.
PS065|Well you claim to be able to.
PS066|No I think it's I can normally yeah.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Mm I'm glad I found out what that is.
PS065|Yeah What the hell's it called a what.
PS066|Erm.
PS065|Something anemone wasn't it.
PS066|Anemone blander.
PS065|Oh yes.
PS066|February to April Requires f the first to flower is A blander February to April Requires full sun as flowers close in shady conditions.
PS065|Mm will it get it there.
PS066|Grow it in the rockery or naturali naturalize it in grassland.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|That sounds like it.
PS065|Well it looks like the illustration doesn't it.
PS066|Well it looks li yes It does.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Mm can go by the leaves I thought the leaves look like it too Well we look like getting if it spreads.
PS065|Has it yeah.
PS066|as much as it has there we look like getting.
PS065|Has it got the same number of petals on it.
PS066|Yes it similar yes It's di that's di they differ.
PS065|Oh yeah Not just the colour and the number of.
PS066|Well I'm not sure but I'm not going out to count them.
PS065|Well it's I would have thought Must get some rose fertiliser you know too because erm I don't suppose the original plants have been fed for generations literally.
PS066|Oh you mean for those ramblers Yeah.
PS065|Yeah Well those ramblers and all over the place mm.
PS066|Mm It looks to me as if it's going to blooming rain again.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|I'm fed up with this weather.
PS065|Well it's a good general purpose fertiliser isn't it.
PS066|Yes What was the other one.
PS065|Growmore.
PS066|Growmore No Erm.
PS065|You're the gardening expert.
PS066|No I think it was the rose fertiliser they said use it for the tomatoes as well.
PS065|Yeah that's right yeah Ah That was right erm it was the tomato fertiliser wasn't it that was quite good for something As well er you know as well as the rose fertiliser.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Yes they can use rose fertiliser for tomatoes But also tomato fertiliser apparently is useful for I don't know Look it up at the end of the book Incidentally what's this er operation that Jenny was on about Er not Jenny Josie was on about this morning that er Jenny had.
PS066|Caesarian.
PS065|Oh she had a caesarian did she I was forgetting she had a caesarian.
PS066|Yes course she has That's probably why it's.
PS065|Of course.
PS066|taken her to get on her feet.
PS065|Of course good god yes I was thinking it was knit one purl one on the stitches you know but mm Of course oh yeah Oh yes Yes it was on the radio this morning about that erm it is in England somewhere I think a woman's given birth to a fifteen pound some ounces kid.
PS066|Oh dear me.
PS065|Good gracious Tremendous size that is isn't it.
PS066|Mm Yeah.
PS065|Mind its weight I don't know about the size but mm We seem to have a tremendous lot of seagulls don't we Over that playing field there.
PS066|Well it's being so windy isn't it.
PS065|Yeah well I no I'm generalizing throughout the year.
PS066|Well we're not that far from the sea are we.
PS065|Of course not that's true Yeah Mm Oh yes but I mean they they seem to concentrate pretty well round these playing fields for some reason blackbird there.
PS066|Yeah I know the way they land.
PS065|Yeah it's interesting to watch the different birds the different methods of landing Some are quite accurate The others are a bit sprawling those blackbirds I think.
PS066|Mm the.
PS065|Yeah caw caw caw That looks like an old one to me doesn't it.
PS066|An old fella.
PS065|Yeah Well not an old fella necessarily.
PS066|I'm still sort of puzzling what the best thing best thing to do for that hedge down there Cos we can't er until we get it cleared all the way along it although it seems to change If you look.
PS065|Hang on What seems to change.
PS066|The hedge If you look from here.
PS065|In what way does it ch.
PS066|Well if you look from here.
PS065|I'm looking from here.
PS066|And then you go along.
PS065|I'm going along.
PS066|By the time it gets to that all that rubbish that we're going to shift.
PS065|Er y oh yes there in front.
PS066|Well then if you look it tends to change to a different variety trees.
PS065|Oh it does there See what you mean Yes Yeah.
PS066|I don't.
PS065|it definitely does change doesn't it Mm.
PS066|I don't know what they are but one of those trees has little catkins on it Very poor.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|So it obviously.
PS065|I'm not surprised they're poor.
PS066|I know I know.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|But erm it wants the roots clearing.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|and feeding and.
PS065|Mm Mm Mhm.
PS066|It's a shame though to let them die because th they're I like to have a a different I don't want it all the same It's boring isn't it.
PS065|Oh you're getting back to the privet hedge and suburbia aren't you.
PS066|That gives interest especially.
PS065|Same.
PS066|into the corner.
PS065|Mm that's why I don't want to clip that erm bottom hedge too cleanly.
PS066|No but I think.
PS065|Lop it down Yes I agree Lop it down but erm.
PS066|I think we need to for th this time round because it'll soon get you know.
PS065|Take its own.
PS065|Mm Mm Yes maybe you're right.
PS066|But I do think for now we're just going to have to cu chop it down.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|It's going to get worse and worse if we don't.
PS065|Have to keep our eyes open for a decent er path cutter hedge cutter you know.
PS066|Yes I looked in the paper to see if there was any.
PS065|No there weren't.
PS066|They're very expensive to buy aren't they.
PS065|Oh new they are certainly yes.
PS066|Yes and you want a double action one.
PS065|Preferably Not essentially.
PS066|I I wouldn't think that erm like the different length of the blades You don't want a very big one.
PS065|I don't think you need the think it's a twenty four is it no.
PS066|I would think they're more trouble than they're worth unless you've got.
PS065|Yeah They could be.
PS066|a great big.
PS065|Mm Oh and you'd have to be that little bit more careful too.
PS066|Mm Yes exactly.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|I think that's what.
PS065|And again unless the motor is fairly hefty.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|it could conceivably be easy to burn the motor out Because it's doing more work isn't it.
PS066|I don't.
PS065|Mm well in theory A bigger area bigger length You're cutting more at the same time.
PS066|Yeah I was looking at the petrol driven ones.
PS065|Good god.
PS066|I know That's what I thought.
PS065|Stone the crows Cor.
PS066|It took me breath away so.
PS065|Good gracious me.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|No no.
PS066|Just how.
PS065|What.
PS066|much erm how much can you cut with those as opposed to having needing the erm the other ones that are used for trees Erm.
PS065|Chainsaw.
PS066|chainsaw I couldn't forget the word The chainsaw.
PS065|Oh they'll take er do a fair amount of work but erm I think certainly as far as the hedge is concerned.
PS066|Well I know that.
PS065|Yeah hang on Hang on In a well established hedge like that.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|I would think er the loppers if the erm hedgecutter won't tackle it the loppers will.
PS066|Yes but what I was thinking more.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|is the rest of the round there round at the side there I mean a lot of the you know when we start getting rid of all the rubbish down that side.
PS065|Er I wouldn't like to put er erm a hedgecutter through that erm that bush there That's a little bit too heavy for it.
PS066|Which bush.
PS065|Well the one where the hedge terminates and.
PS066|Mm well.
PS065|That dead looking e well dead.
PS066|No No but would it do to I mean you're going to have a lot of the stuff that we chopped off.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|to put to if we're getting a trailer and getting rid of it all.
PS065|Yeah Yeah.
PS066|You're going to have to cut it down still further into smaller pieces aren't you to get as much as you can in the trailer.
PS065|Oh I see what you mean to cram on the trailer Yes Yes yes.
PS066|Will a hedgecutter do there or will you have to u revert to erm a chainsaw.
PS065|Er combination of both I should think I well I'm not too concerned about that anyway I can use the loppers If we were doing it seven days a week fair enough you'd probably need a chainsaw but anything the loppers or the handsaw.
PS066|Oh handsaw Oh that's hard work.
PS065|No No no no no not the really not the thick ones.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|But erm.
PS066|Well I was just thinking of taking the work out of it.
PS066|Mm it's one hell of a lot of work.
PS065|But you see we don't really need a chainsaw do we.
PS066|No I wouldn't say so normal but er there's quite a lot to.
PS065|No No No To hire one possibly for a specific specific job but.
PS066|I wonder how much they are to hire.
PS065|Not very dear.
PS066|Oh aren't they.
PS065|What erm chainsaws.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|I think last time I looked at the hire list price price list.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|I think about five six quid a day something like that they were last year Mm.
PS066|Oh that's not bad really.
PS065|Oh it isn't bad if you've got a lot of erm chainsaw work to do That can be done in a day you know.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|Mm Now whether that's erm including all the protective clothing or not I du n no.
PS066|I don't know.
PS065|There might be a different charge for that but.
PS066|Er did you think any more about the er rubbish clearance that was they were advertising in the paper I mean whatd' you think.
PS065|Oh the twelve quid's worth wasn't it Was it twelve Sixteen.
PS066|Sixteen quid for one load What's a load.
PS065|What is well yes Anything that'll fill a skip it'll be a skip.
PS066|Skip.
PS065|And I suspect that'll be the smallest skip I don't know.
PS066|I would imagine so.
PS065|Did it say from What did it just say.
PS066|No I think it just said sixteen pounds a load and I.
PS065|Mm Mm Mm.
PS066|thought mm I wonder how much a load is.
PS065|Well yes it's probably the smallest skip.
PS066|But it'd save a lot of hard work if you got rid of quite a lot of it.
PS065|See I don't see erm them shifting very much for that because by the time you've got a bloke out paid his wages paid for the the erm skip shifter transporter you know.
PS066|Well if this is a skip It might just be a trailer.
PS065|It might be a trailer It might be an open back lorry you know.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|A lorry.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|Well we could get rid of qu I doubt it whether they're going to shift that.
PS065|Well you know mm.
PS066|I doubt that.
PS065|But again on a costing basis I mean hourly How long is it gon na take a chap to load loads.
PS066|Yes but I'm thinking I mean there's so much to do here Larry you er you know you're not a young man any more You can't er do too much.
PS065|Er I had noticed Yes Yes Yes.
PS066|It's no good wearing yourself out if you can get anything done.
PS065|I was worn out already What are you on about.
PS066|You know what I mean.
PS065|I'm knackered Mm.
PS066|But it makes sense to me to have a little bit of help.
PS065|Oh I'm not adverse to having bit of help.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|you know of the right sort No no no no no no no Erm.
PS066|You're usually pretty independent.
PS065|A little perhaps but er I mean you can have people that are more damn trouble than they're worth can't you Quite honestly.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Spend your time watching.
PS066|Well you know the all the stuff that you've got at the side where.
PS065|Ah well that's straight on the trailer yeah.
PS066|Is it.
PS065|Well more more or less yeah One or two things I'll be keeping but most of it it's just straight that's why it's all piled up ready to go.
PS066|Ah but I wasn't just meaning on the concrete bit I was meaning on the soil There's loads and loads of what you trimmed off the.
PS065|Oh that's not rubbish that's just erm off the trees isn't it.
PS066|Well it's still got to be got rid of hasn't it.
PS065|Chuck it over the fence and it'll go straight in more or less straight in the trailer won't it.
PS066|It'll be just like you to get your trailer and your car down there when er arrive and.
PS065|Oh highly probable Sod's law yes.
PS066|I know I can't get over the fact that that all.
PS065|What.
PS066|all through the winter we've had daisies all over the grass.
PS065|Oh yes you mean the fact that they've been in flower Mm Mm.
PS066|You don't usually see daisies do you.
PS065|I honestly don't know Nina I don't know.
PS066|Mm don't think it's dry enough to cut the grass is it.
PS065|Oh I w no I wouldn't do it today No crikey no.
PS066|No I don't think so It doesn't look very promising.
PS065|No.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|It makes it hard work doesn't it.
PS065|Oh yes.
PS066|Have to do a bit at a time.
PS065|I'm going to investigate see if I can't do a conv I don't think for one minute I will but it's possible do a conversion er into erm the box type Cos that way all the or most of the cuttings at least go into the box wouldn't they It's possible.
PS066|Oh it might be more trouble than it's worth.
PS065|It might be It might sound a bit potty but utilizing that small vacuum cleaner and cutting the erm.
PS066|Ah don't use.
PS065|No.
PS066|No I I prefer using it just as it is quite frankly.
PS065|Well i it's not a big thing it's only you know what I mean don't you That yellow and green one.
PS066|Yes I know what you mean but I don't fancy you messing about with the grasscutter.
PS065|No.
PS066|Cos I find it if there's anything else attached to it.
PS065|It depends which mounting Keep the centre of gravity low and there'd be no problems.
PS066|No I don't I can't agree with you there.
PS065|Mm Maybe not no.
PS066|No leave well alone.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|don't you And then you just make a mess of what you've already got.
PS065|It's quite possible but erm.
PS066|Mm but I I mean I can use it as it is now but anything else on to it I would find it difficult.
PS065|Well I'm gon na bash on with the erm.
PS066|Right are you ready for the window yet.
PS065|Well er yes please We can do it now then.
PS066|Well I'll come and do that then.
PS065|Okay Right And hopefully by teatime I should have got the burning done Right away we go.
