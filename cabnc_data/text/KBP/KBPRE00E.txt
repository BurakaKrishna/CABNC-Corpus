PS066|This one.
PS065|Mhm.
PS066|It looks very small It's an end terrace She wouldn't rule out an end terrace but.
PS065|Ah is that the one the Barratt type place.
PS066|Well I yes.
PS065|Yeah well.
PS066|Well that looks like a Barratt type as well doesn't it.
PS065|Yes Exactly yes It's the same estate isn't it.
PS065|It is yeah The same address same area.
PS066|Yes it is.
PS065|Yeah.
PS065|But there's quite a difference in price if you notice.
PS066|Forty two for this.
PS065|And thirty something for that Thirty seven I think it was something like that Could be wrong.
PS066|Yes it is but I think this is the one erm this is.
PS065|This is this is this is.
PS066|Erm wait a minute.
PS065|Mhm I don't like either to be honest with you but there we are.
PS066|Oh I don't dislike them but it's not one that.
PS065|Well if you weigh that other one up the end one.
PS066|This which This one.
PS065|Yeah There wouldn't be room for the caravan to start with.
PS066|I thought there would.
PS065|No I don't think so no Yeah.
PS066|I think you'd find there would.
PS065|No I don't think there would be.
PS066|That's well it looks like it to me.
PS065|Mm Mm Full stop That'd be it.
PS066|Just let's read what it says.
PS065|Mm No room for a garage No parking a car is there From what I can see of it.
PS066|Mm style entrance door which opens.
PS065|Oh yeah.
PS066|to the entrance hall.
PS065|It's erm important to remember by the way.
PS066|What.
PS065|Well some estates not many of course but some estates have got a no go area for caravans parked don't they Mm I don't think we're likely to meet it here to be honest with you but yes you do get it.
PS066|Ah well there's a caravan parked round the corner.
PS065|Well I'm just saying I just said that we're not likely to get it here.
PS066|No.
PS065|But erm it would be a damn sight safer down here wouldn't it It wouldn't get vandalized broken into scratched bashed or whatever.
PS066|Grounds here we are.
PS065|Tell me the.
PS066|Lawn just a mo.
PS065|Mm Go on.
PS066|Property stands within established principally lawned garden.
PS065|Yeah I read it Yeah.
PS066|shrubs trees.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|Privacy from the roadway which is what she would like.
PS065|Depends what you mean by privacy of course but go on Privacy or privacy as they seem to say these days don't they sometimes.
PS066|Well I say privacy I don't know.
PS065|carry on saying it whether it's right or wrong Same with controversy and controversy.
PS066|Controversy.
PS065|I know I still It's a real controversy though.
PS066|Yeah I.
PS065|Controversy God you've got me at it.
PS065|You see.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|How easily you can change Good gracious me.
PS065|Did you notice this morning on the box the er weather girl.
PS066|No I didn't.
PS065|She uses controversy and er.
PS066|Did she.
PS065|Our friend what's his name Mike is it.
PS066|Yes.
PS065|Yes He did the accidental I'm sure controversy.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|Mm And she.
PS066|It's it's easier to say for some reason or other and yet.
PS065|Well it is for us because we've always been saying it But I don't see any reason why it should be easier.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Controversy controversy It's just accent on the.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm Fed up with plaster up me nose and.
PS066|I'm fed up with this stage altogether.
PS065|Oh strewth yeah.
PS066|I'll be glad when we get it cleaned and we can start the actual.
PS065|There's quite a lot of it to do yet.
PS066|decorating bit.
PS065|Well we're it's it's the er first principles prepare your surfaces isn't it Which we're doing.
PS066|Oh I know that.
PS065|No But that's the mm Well we've finished the burning off in there Yeah so that's one pong gone Very largely gone It still lingers on a bit though.
PS066|Oh yes.
PS065|There's not an awful lot more filling to do but there is a bit of course.
PS066|Erm not plaster there's no more plastering is there.
PS065|I sincerely hope not No there's no more plastering No No Just filling now Imperfections you know Joints and stuff like that And that it's a pity about that but I'm leaving the damn thing.
PS066|Oh yes.
PS065|Fancy putting boss white.
PS066|You know what they say Never trouble trouble.
PS065|Oh I know If it works leave it alone but.
PS066|I'll say.
PS065|erm on balance it's best left on and to just.
PS066|Well it is really.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|if we can get away with it.
PS065|Oh yes I'd far sooner take it off and do a proper job but well.
PS066|It er well it's easier isn't it really But on the.
PS065|Well.
PS066|other hand you might have problems with it leaking if you take it off anyway so.
PS065|Well that's a p yes exactly yes Cos.
PS066|No if you've got to.
PS065|and I've got to scrape out all that horrible boss white Cos it goes rock hard that stuff over the years you know.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Boss white.
PS066|I wonder whether it was leaking in when they put it in in the first place.
PS065|Do you mean that's why they used boss white Possibly Yeah Mm.
PS066|Well let's not erm ask for trouble because there's more than enough to do without having.
PS065|Oh quite yes Mm Have you noticed that by and large not all the time of course but I should say that eighty percent of the time birds face that way.
PS066|No I've never noticed which cos I'm.
PS065|Mm Cos see that pigeon is now.
PS066|Oh yeah.
PS065|In the tree yeah Mm By far the majority of the time.
PS066|It looks like a picture doesn't it sometimes With those trees.
PS065|Oh god yes Yes.
PS066|I've never seen so many perch in one tree.
PS065|Mm Facing basically west aren't they.
PS066|Mm That's true.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Look at that pigeon.
PS065|pardon.
PS066|sat there.
PS065|Yes Yeah.
PS066|The windows are filthy outside.
PS065|Mm You don't often get one pigeon though do you There's usually at least two of them.
PS066|Well you usually have two together don't you.
PS065|Yeah exactly Yeah.
PS066|Ooh that door.
PS065|Yes that was getting on my wick that door yeah.
PS066|Shut up door.
PS065|Mm I was bunged up before I started this bunged up now.
PS066|I wonder who I wonder who chopped and vandalized all those daffodils round the corner.
PS065|Well and the fact that it was just their garden and as far as I can make out it was simply that garden it would suggest that she's fallen out with some kids or something like that or somebody and yeah.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|I mean why pick on one garden and systematically.
PS066|Well they probably thing yes but cabbages Fancy taking cabbages.
PS065|I don't think they'd been actually taken from what I can gather.
PS066|Well what did they do to them Oh just cut them.
PS065|They slashed them about yes Cut them all Mm.
PS066|Peculiar thing to do.
PS065|Oh according to Josie I really don't know about all the cabbages it might consist of one or two Funny business yeah.
PS066|Oh it's a shame though isn't it.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|All the time you spend waiting for the blooming things to grow.
PS065|That's Yvonne's mother isn't it Yeah.
PS066|That's right.
PS065|Didn't Yvonne say she can be an awkward old devil.
PS066|Oh I don't know.
PS065|Mm So I sh.
PS065|yes She's probably fallen out with some kid or other.
PS066|You can't be sure of that.
PS065|Oh no no no no no If there'd been a trail of destruction down the road then fair enough but.
PS066|I couldn't er go and vandalize something I mean a thing like flowers.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|They're so nice that.
PS065|Well we think so Obviously there's others that don't think so but not everybody thinks so.
PS066|Well a lot of people like I mean most people like flowers don't they.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|Whether you grow them or not's a difference but most people.
PS065|Yeah yeah Oh true true They're not an ug ugly thing.
PS066|like them.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|And I couldn't go and vandalize something that was nice.
PS065|No No.
PS066|There's some peculiar minds some people have don't they.
PS065|Oh yeah it's very small beer really isn't it Compared to some of the dodges they get up to.
PS066|It is really.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Have you decided whereabouts you're going to put that light at the front.
PS065|Light Er well no the well at the front Other than that over the door area somewhere I don't know exactly I might stick it on a flying lead and wander around with it for a bit and see where it's best.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|But I've got a rough idea where it'll go anyway.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|of course is cable running to it providing it with power I'll probably run it from the garage.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|About the easiest source.
PS066|On the corner I think would be perhaps a good idea do you think Between the garage and the house.
PS065|Do you mean the return If you come from the front of the house going towards the garage that little bit there There's two feet or something.
PS066|No I thought you were going to put it facing the front.
PS065|I am yes Well what do you mean then the corner.
PS066|On the co on the front of the house at the corner.
PS065|Yes you mean literally on the corner The apex of two.
PS066|Yes.
PS065|Well I'd have to make something to mount it on to go right on the corner but.
PS066|Well I know that Well wherever you put it you're going to have to make something to mount it on.
PS065|No No No No.
PS066|Why.
PS065|It'll screw drive on to a flat surface Brickwork.
PS065|Yeah Certainly it will Yeah Mm.
PS066|How high up are you thinking of putting it.
PS065|Above a vandal.
PS066|How high How high is the one we've got at the back.
PS065|Well so you've got to get up a ladder to get at it Er up a step ladder I mean not a.
PS066|I think about above the number.
PS065|I'd thought roughly speaking in that area yes but.
PS066|Er yes well somewhere there.
PS065|Ah well that would illuminate the er see if I put it fairly close to the actual corner at the front side going down towards the garage Close to that corner still lighting on the front face but.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|then a percentage of light will go round the corner Well cos lights don't go round corners but.
PS066|What about on the garage above what about on the garage.
PS065|No.
PS066|No.
PS065|No that would throw the front door into shadow wouldn't it.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|Well above the number then Cos you're nearly you know more or less on the corner there anyway aren't you.
PS065|Mm like I say that would be mm Oh that way I can then get a decent cable run I think to the garage For feed you know.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm Well that's the easiest bit To the circuit yeah.
PS066|What's that then.
PS065|That is It will be helpful though having a light there.
PS066|Oh yes.
PS065|Because at night you get a percentage a a.
PS066|Yes you do.
PS065|degree of light I should say from that street lighting but not an awful lot.
PS066|Not the same no.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|No it is handy having the light.
PS065|And for people coming in going out for the step.
PS066|Yeah.
PS065|whatever you know Mm.
PS065|It'll be a quite sufficient spread to to cope with the er entrance to the garage I mean you know Mm I still think two rows of erm pavers stones inbetween's the best bet for the front you know To put there There's only one problem.
PS066|You mean to the garage.
PS065|Well the approach to the garage yeah The drive.
PS066|Like Mike's got at in their.
PS065|Er yes Yes Exactly Yeah The usual thing yeah.
PS066|Well you get a erm.
PS065|You get a what.
PS066|You get a lot of weeds where the chippings are.
PS065|No not if you put sodium chlorate down Nothing'll grow then Good grief.
PS066|The thing is if you.
PS065|If you what.
PS066|erm I'm just thinking if like when anybody comes to stay.
PS065|Yeah Yeah.
PS066|and you run the car or somebody runs the car the other way.
PS065|Up the sides yeah Yeah.
PS066|Well then you're going across you're not staying st er you're not on the pavers are you.
PS065|No well that doesn't really matter I mean the erm in fact there's only one fairly tight path you can follow to get the car in Into the side If you think about it.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|It'll be worth putting a couple of pavers on there just to cope with the track of the pa er the wheels going in.
PS066|Oh wouldn't that look a bit odd.
PS065|Not necessarily no No I don't mean put down like bloody tramlines.
PS066|What like I have down the garden there.
PS065|A railway line in No no Actually it's quite attractive.
PS066|A walk you know walk.
PS065|that actually.
PS066|Well it is but it.
PS065|I was looking at it again this morning Yeah.
PS066|I thought that.
PS065|Ooh hark at her.
PS066|Yes Well I think some of the bricks could when you decide wha which you're going to use and which you mm.
PS065|Well they want stabilizing a bit yeah and er.
PS066|I'll get some of those bricks up and put the stone things down cos they look better.
PS065|Mm Mm Mhm.
PS066|As long as I can get walk along and get to all the plants there What do you think of that I'd definitely think about moving those other pavers at the bottom There we were the steps are.
PS065|Oh lifting them you mean you mean Oh god.
PS066|Yeah That would make th give it a better erm.
PS065|Yes Yeah.
PS066|I don't see any reason for that to be quite honest why they've done that.
PS065|Well there was at the time obviously Cos do you remember there was that erm monstrous creation I should say erection erection for erm.
PS066|Oh I know that Well there's still some of those stones at underneath that.
PS065|The foundation exactly I know yeah.
PS066|We've got to move those before we grow anything.
PS066|I've put some of the bricks over one side so that'll eliminate getting rid of one side of them.
PS065|No I'm not with you.
PS066|Well where I've put me bricks they're.
PS065|Yes.
PS066|on top of some of those stones that are underneath.
PS065|I'm with you now It's fairly deep eight inches down the bricks.
PS066|I know.
PS065|I know I went quite a way down.
PS066|You did.
PS065|I mean honestly you'd have thought they were building a ruddy house there wouldn't you.
PS066|I wonder what they did it for.
PS065|That's only er I don't know It's the same with the greenhouse.
PS066|It was a right monstrosity that thing wasn't it.
PS065|They'd have had a nine inch thick.
PS065|erm solid concrete path in the centre Who the hell.
PS066|I know.
PS065|wants that In the middle of the co.
PS066|Stupid.
PS065|er of the greenhouse.
PS066|Talking about stones we'll have to have a trip up to the erm.
PS066|that er yard to see if You know when we went to see about the flagstones.
PS065|Oh there Yes yes.
PS066|I've not seen any there's not been any more in erm workmen in It's a good idea that going up there.
PS065|Well oh dear I've kept my eyes open when we're going through Harford.
PS066|No sign.
PS065|and there's no signs of work Mark you it wasn't a brilliant day was it So.
PS066|No it wasn't Well we just have must have just missed them.
PS065|Yeah.
PS065|Yeah oh yeah yeah Cos those were definitely new ones ready for placing in.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|A a pile of stones Oh yeah.
PS066|So the old ones they'd have taken back to that yard place wouldn't they.
PS065|Well no No no no.
PS066|What do they do with them.
PS065|No straight to the tip.
PS066|Well that's the place that.
PS065|That's not the tip.
PS066|Where we went.
PS065|Yeah That's not the tip.
PS066|Well which was the tip.
PS065|You've never been to the tip I don't think no you've not.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|It's erm Tearscross way You know the quarry Well the quarry area anyway the same road.
PS066|Oh so I've never.
PS065|You can approach it two ways From erm.
PS066|I thought it was there.
PS066|They had a lot of stones there.
PS065|No no no.
PS066|didn't they.
PS065|That's just bits they've had on various trucks Lorries and things.
PS066|Oh.
PS065|No no.
PS066|Oh I see.
PS065|No no The tip is where I went The first time I went I followed the route recommended by Peter Peter which on a map looks quicker but it isn't cos it's a winding.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|country road single track in a lot of directions.
PS066|Do they just heave the bricks They just heave them They don't.
PS065|Apparently yes.
PS066|sell them off or anything.
PS065|No No they don't they just they stick them on to.
PS066|Mm They'd serve our purpose very well there.
PS065|Mm Mm.
PS066|because there's such an awful lot to do.
PS065|Mm.
PS066|We could bring them right well the two that are down there could come.
PS065|Yeah.
PS066|It would save you a lot of cementing wouldn't it.
PS065|On indeed it would yes It would.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|Mm I'll be giving that mixer a caning this year though.
PS066|Pardon.
PS065|I hope to give the mixer a caning this year.
PS066|I hope you do too.
PS065|Yeah Mm.
PS066|wondering what to do next.
PS065|Mm Oh yes yes.
PS066|When you come to think of it though it's s to me it makes sense to start at the top where we have done and work your way down doesn't it.
PS065|In some ways it is sensible yes because you're carrying muck down.
PS066|Well of course you are.
PS065|Yeah I mean down when we've done down here we've pu god been putting mats down and lord knows what to.
PS066|Mm.
PS065|oh yeah Mm But the erm ceiling rose and preferably the light switch could do with replacing.
PS066|Oh I know the ce oh the ceiling rose they're horrible those old things aren't they.
PS065|Mm Well the the lighting switch isn't so clever either.
PS066|No.
PS065|And before I put too much back I want to have the floorboards up to clear.
