PS0DX|overdo it you see.
PS0E5|Yeah.
PS0DX|And end up falling flat on her face or something like that.

PS0DX|meals and.
PS0DY|ev evening meals things like.

PS0E4|That's the trouble That's what I tell everybody when they say to me oh no you know we never go out for a meal I say well shouldn't be such a good cook I mean there's quite a few husbands I know that absolutely hate being out They only like their wives'.
PS0E4|cooking And I said you know well if you weren't a good cook he'd be glad to go out and have one.

KCBPSUN|Hello Neil.
KCBPSUN|Hello Barbara.
KCBPSUN|All the best.
KCBPSUN|Yep er yeah.
KCBPSUN|isn't it shocking.
KCBPSUN|Yeah.
PS0E6|Hello.
KCBPSUN|Yeah Hi.
PS0DX|Oh it's a.
PS0DX|just trying to sort out this business of this the offices that we're being let in the Strand Theatre that er people are moving in this week and they've got no authority to move you see.
PS0DY|Really.
PS0DX|This is what Ni I spoke to Nigel about on the phone on Friday and said he could.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0DX|stop it so so he had to erm just talk to our solicitors this morning and try and get this sorted out between the two solicitors.
PS0DY|Did you get through to him.
PS0DX|Yes yes got through Well not David it's a er Susan got.
PS0DY|Mm.
PS0DX|Susan.
PS0E6|Have you read it now cos I shall have to.
KCBPSUN|Hello.
PS0DX|So erm.
PS0E6|take it back I can't do it can you do these.
KCBPSUN|How have you been alright.
PS0E5|That a bathroom cabinet up there.
PS0DX|so they're you know explain the situation to her because it's between the two solicitors to sort out now and get the writ writ sorted out before anything could be signed to to allow them to move in.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0DX|It's a tricky situation actually because.
PS0DY|Well what do you say the.
PS0DX|the lease.
PS0DY|the.
PS0DX|well th the the people who have the actual lease of the offices have gone out o er gone out of business in a sense they're no longer operating and because they were part of a bigger organization that bigger organization guaranteed the rents Now this bigger or this other organization which wants to put th er another tenant in as in a as a sub-let to their lease.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0DX|and I am saying that they haven't got the lease.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0DX|even though they might be part and parcel of the same organization they are not the leaseholders so they can't make the arrangements so if they want to make the arrangement they must have the lease assigned to them first then we will come to terms with them over land and to under le under let.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0DX|But you know they're just being going on as if they are i in a position to grant.
PS0DY|To do.
PS0DX|to do And having said that we haven't at this moment approved an under-let anyway so.
PS0DY|No.
PS0DX|But you know the situation is difficult in that if the people did move in there's not a lot you can do about it because it would mean that you would have to surrender the lease which means you've let the guarantors off the hook for paying the then and you're left without a tenant whatsoever Erm it's it's trying to get an amicable solution to it.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0DX|Oh.
PS0DY|Darling will you get me a a scone another scone teacake.
PS0DX|Teacake Aha.
PS0DY|and erm and a coffee.
PS0DX|Okay Okay.
PS0DY|Can you er pay pay.
PS0DX|Ye yes.
PS0DY|er.
PS0DX|Yep Teacake I don't remember ooh ah toasted teacake oh it's fifty five What do you have tea or coffee.
PS0DY|Coffee.
PS0DX|Coffee Hundred and seventeen a hundred and seventy two again isn't it So I will pay that What have you done to yourself that hurts.
KCBPSUN|Put my back out again.
PS0DX|Put your back out.
KCBPSUN|Yeah.
PS0DX|Oh One seventy two.
KCBPSUN|Is it Oh right.
PS0DX|Thank you madam.
KCBPSUN|Thank you.
PS0DX|Thank you.
KCBPSUN|You oft are you.
PS0DX|I'm off now yes.
KCBPSUN|Okay then.
PS0DX|Mm Yes yes.
PS0E5|Anything.
PS0DX|yes.
PS0E5|exciting at the office No.
PS0DX|Oh well yes.
PS0DY|Well lots of mail.
PS0E5|Lots of mail.
PS0DX|Lots of mail An interesting situation which I've just explained to Ann whereby at the weekend there's a set of offices in the Strand Theatre which the company that we're operating from there so stopped.
PS0E5|Can you manage.
PS0DX|business.
KCBPSUN|Yeah.
PS0DX|but they're part of a much bigger organization who.
PS0E5|Mm.
PS0DX|was guaranteeing the rent so the rent has been paid even.
PS0E5|Paid.
PS0DX|though the office.
PS0E5|Yeah.
PS0DX|has been vacated and they wanted to grant an under-let to another.
PS0E5|Yeah.
PS0DX|body of people to try and reduce the rent they were paying erm but it it's er it's initially a difficult situation that we have said yes we don't mind you erm we don't mind granting you that but we want to know if you will accept an assignment of the lease from the previous company cos.
PS0E5|Mm.
PS0DX|from our point of view in nineteen ninety three we have to deal with somebody over a revision of the rent and if the company doesn't exist it makes it very difficult.
PS0E5|Yeah Yeah Quite Yeah.
PS0DX|You see so these people were going to move in at the weekend so had to put a stop to that cos they had no authority to move in there until the solicitors try and get this thing sorted out.
PS0E5|I wonder what they'll do.
PS0DX|But it ma it's a it leaves you this interesting situation in that if they had moved in what do you do cancel the lease and get them out Which means the guarantor no longer has to pay you the rent so you you don't really want to forego that either yeah.
PS0E5|So you really bit of a clever stick aren't you.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0E5|Yeah Very very.
PS0DX|However it'll all come out.
PS0E5|It'll come out in the wash I guess.
PS0DX|Right yes.
PS0DX|So there we are.
PS0E5|There we are Well thank you for your company this morning madam.
PS0DY|Thank you yes.
