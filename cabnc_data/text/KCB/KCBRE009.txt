PS0DX|That's what I said a hundred and ninety pound I said if you could do my house for that I'd be laughing.
PS0DY|I think it's marvellous.
PS0E2|But it's well considering he had to re-putty all the windows it wasn't just like he had to one.
PS0DY|I think that is very good.

PS0DX|Yeah.
PS0E2|literally.
PS0DY|Yeah.

PS0DY|Yep.
PS0E2|and get that done.
PS0DX|Well I've had the mower serviced.

PS0E2|A ne ne ne new one.
PS0DX|No very good No they've really cleaned it up it looks beautiful.
PS0E2|Good.
PS0DX|Well it's never been serviced since the day we bought it and that must be a good ten years ago.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0E3|Did you have the blades sharpened and that.
PS0DY|Yes.
PS0DX|Well I put new blades on actually.
PS0DY|Really really good.
PS0DX|er and that was one of the problems I couldn't tighten them I didn't have.
PS0E3|Yeah.
PS0DX|the right equipment because they're awkward to put on because the nuts are on the top of the on the top of the blade.
PS0E3|Yeah.
PS0DX|So you got ta get away and underneath and I haven't got the rer rer the socket spanners that would do it so well I haven't got a spanner let alone a socket ones that would do it And er.
PS0E2|Do you want a bit of lemon juice in your drink.
PS0DX|Yes please love.
PS0E2|Father.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0DX|So I told them that it had new blades on but they wanted it really tight and they wanted tightening up and that so yeah I saved them and I put them car engine oil in Which was partly the reason why I wanted it serviced it.
PS0E2|There's yours then.
PS0DY|moved up the car is it over.
PS0E2|It's okay But George.
PS0DX|Yeah I thought it was very good with this erm the thirty six for the servicing plus your part that they.
PS0E3|That's better I had my er serviced yesterday.
PS0DX|That wasn't thirty six pounds I bet.
PS0E3|Er no hundred and twenty for.
PS0DX|Ye.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0E3|But actually I paid cash and it.
PS0DY|No.
PS0E3|had everything done it had brakes had the lot Whole lot.
PS0DX|Wish I could get mine done for that.
PS0E3|Well it's a mechanic that we use.
PS0DX|Oh.
PS0E3|and er just did.
PS0DY|Oh.
PS0E3|me a favour.
PS0DY|Running.
PS0E2|Whe then again is yo could I go to Southampton and.
PS0E3|Mm.
PS0E2|and back in it.
PS0DY|Well exactly.
PS0E2|I expect my car to be.
PS0DY|Of course it does.
PS0E2|Oh well Cos I'm doing about what about three hundred fi three hundred fifty miles a week just going to work and back.
PS0DX|Oh that is what fifteen thousand fifteen to twenty thousand a year isn't it.
PS0DY|You do almost twenty thousand miles a year.
PS0DX|Yeah.
PS0E2|I know.
PS0DY|Bits Picks up all.
PS0E2|No.
PS0DY|the mess now in one go.
PS0DX|That's not bad actually Sarah cos I mean when I come home for lunch at.
PS0E2|It is when you.
PS0DX|when I come home for lunch er and things like that I clock up about two hundred and twenty to two thirty two fifty maybe a week just.
PS0E2|I do forty miles a day.
PS0DX|doing that.
PS0E2|going to work and back.
PS0DX|Yeah.
PS0E3|Yeah but Sarah doesn't use a car much er.
PS0E2|Oh no.
PS0E3|most of the time.
PS0E2|No that's right Do on the odd occasion but.
PS0DX|Yeah.
PS0E2|no you just use it for that and I'm not going anywhere else.
PS0DX|No.
PS0E2|cos once I'm parked I'm parked.
PS0DX|Well yeah.
PS0E2|No I mean but there might be an earlier promotion now.
PS0DY|Oh really.
PS0DX|Wha what this is in the management side.
PS0E2|Oh yeah er well be a different one to that to start with but it'll be earlier What's actually happened is first of all Tracey's leaving she's been promoted to Area Telesales Manager for Talking Pages so she's going up to Slough and Michelle will be going for that position and one other girl and the two others that are on management development one is now leaving cos she's like burnt out she doesn't want to do it any more and the other one's going into the field so it's literally just me and this other girl and Michelle but I'm obviously just starting but next time around it'll just be me again Di and Dianna is good at her work.
PS0DY|Mm.
PS0E2|but she jus just hasn't got a personality.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0E2|Erm she's a very aggressive person.
PS0DX|Oh right.
PS0E2|And manner.
PS0DY|Oh yeah.
PS0E2|not not even like in the right situation she's like just aggressive all the time and nobody particularly gets on with her or likes her because of this And they do say that they don't feel that unless she changed her personality.
PS0DX|Mm.
PS0E2|she probably wouldn't become a manager because usually you think you can change and develop but I think she'll be then be able to become a manager and she'll sort of learn but she'd have to actually change her personality for it.
PS0E3|Would she have to change her personality or not.
PS0E2|Shut up But er so hopefully Michelle will get this next Tracey's position and obviously sort of in in the meantime and providing her position comes up they are bringing in a Telesales County Secretary which wasn't gon na come in for about a year cos they wanted to sort of like trial it but now they've decided if that's what they want the position to do erm it'll probably happen in the next two months and they said for me to go for it from our division so I said right okay.
PS0E3|Oh she won't like that.
PS0DX|That'll be in Southend will it still.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|Good.
PS0E2|Well it's actually just basically the team it's a new position that they've actually made within each team now within each division which is like you're dealing with higher accounts but a different type of account as well.
PS0DX|Oh jolly good.
PS0DY|Oh very good.
PS0E2|So.
PS0DY|Very good.
PS0E2|It's all looking good.
PS0DY|Sarah Sorry Ca can I have some sugar.
PS0E2|Do you want sugar.
PS0DY|Yes please.
PS0E2|Do you normally usually have sugar.
PS0DX|She has since.
PS0DY|Yes in these.
PS0DX|she's been in the hospital.
PS0E2|bad habit.
PS0DX|In fact I bought.
PS0DY|I know.
PS0DX|I found in that chemist shop when I was looking there er refill Nutrene.
PS0E2|What made you start on sugar again.
PS0DX|So those.
PS0DY|Well I I like it.
PS0DX|so she'll be able to refill all those two Nutrene packs what.
PS0DY|Yeah.

PS0DX|The arthritis man yes We haven't got.
PS0E2|I was gon na say for the other one.
PS0DX|But we haven't got his yet.
PS0E2|That's got ta be more than that cos that's basically what my fares cost.
PS0DX|Well his'll be a thousand pound for the operation being a major operation it will be the fact that it's skull.
PS0DY|It'll be very very expensive.
PS0E2|Well when I had my boob done including consultation his was about seven hundred pound.

PS0DY|I never.
PS0DX|er.
PS0DY|even knew that one.
PS0DX|but he won't get that now for it because they've graded them so that if it's it's keyhole surgery type now it's er it's a lower figure than.
PS0E2|Because you're not actually opening them up.
PS0DX|That's right.

PS0DY|Oh dear.
PS0DX|Watched an interesting programme the other night on Q E D er it was to do with people who have hare lips and cleft palates.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|where th the a apparently you know they put them right as se when you're very young now.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|but they have found that in a lot of cases that the bones starts growing so therefore when you're in your late teens twenties maturing your bottom jaw is growing out from the rest of your jaw bone So they had this girl which they showed er where they had to break all the bone up under here.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|and rewire it and pull the who.
PS0E3|That's oh that was on telly weren't it.
PS0DX|Sorry.
PS0E3|That was on telly yesterday.
PS0DX|On Q E D Yeah but but of course this chap has been doing this research in erm Bangladesh wasn't it I think But you know some of the cleft palates you saw and they were.
PS0DY|They were terrible.
PS0DX|Oh Pull yo co co well you can imagine why people hid themselves away And this chap I mean he was oh this it was almost sickening to look at.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|And this th th this three surgeons go out from here and they do all their research on the various and they operate from eighto'clock at night to eight in the morning non-stop using three theatres each doing a forty five minutes one and then another one takes.
PS0E2|Cos they can't eat properly with cleft palates anyway.
PS0DY|No.
PS0E2|can they.
PS0DX|No.
PS0DY|No.
PS0DX|And this chap in pen and it showed them drawing on his lips when he was anaesthetized where you.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|thought he'd cut and things like this and then they showed you the chap the next day and he was completely different He he could walk down the street without people looking and staring at him They're amazing.
PS0DY|Terrible for them They're awful.
PS0DX|Amazing what they can do now But but they're saying that ooh apart from I think the what they're really saying is that it's better to wait till in.
PS0E2|You're older.
PS0DX|you're older and do it then.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|because as I say.
PS0E2|At least.

PS0E2|The one you want.
PS0DY|Well that's all I have to do I think.
PS0DX|The danger number is five.
PS0DY|Yes.
PS0DX|Cos that's Lyndsey They'll be calling me pretty soon and getting me on th.
PS0E2|Is that a good to actually programme that one in then.
PS0DY|I think quite.
PS0DX|Well I don't.
PS0DY|quite honestly it's very ee I think somebody's going to have it.
PS0DX|I only did it cos it was such a long number to put in all the.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|time I didn't put Debbie's in because we don't ring New Zealand as much as ring Hong Kong but but I've thought of it being a dangerous number but I'm there it is.
PS0E2|Yeah Ah.
PS0E3|We've got loads of numbers on this phone They're good these because if they've got display on them.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0E3|you can put the name in.
PS0DX|Oh.
PS0E3|So er say I want ring Sarah at work.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0E3|I put er er if I put the first letter of it er er it's S that'll search it and it'll say Sarah work.
PS0DX|Oh I see.
PS0E3|and then the phone number then all you've got to do is press send and it'll ring it.
PS0DX|Oh.
PS0E3|And then if I if I want to ring home see I'll press that that just brings up the.
PS0DX|Oh.
PS0E3|yeah then press that one is at home if I just press send.
PS0E2|Yeah.
PS0E3|and then it rings it.
PS0DX|Yeah That's off your.
PS0DX|car is it.
PS0E3|Yeah this is a car put that out the way.
PS0DX|Car phone yeah.
PS0E3|so tha that's all it is.
PS0DX|Yes I see.
PS0E3|Then you just.
PS0DX|Vodaphone or whatever it is.
PS0E3|you just plug it in there and charge the battery up.
PS0DX|Oh.
PS0E3|We got one for the car you plug it in the cigarette lighter.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0E3|and that fills the battery up Great They're a little expensive Bloody expensive to use as well.
PS0DY|What are.
PS0E2|Mobile phones.
PS0E3|Those phones.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0DY|Are they.
PS0DX|Yeah Cellnet phones.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0DX|are.
PS0E3|That is twenty five pound a month line rental.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0E3|oh it it depends I don't think ours we've actually got twenty five pound at the moment that's I du n no that's that's what it normally is and it's twenty five P or thirty.
PS0DX|Ooh.
PS0E3|five P a minute.
PS0DX|Oh yes.
PS0E3|So it's quite expensive.
PS0DY|It is very expensive in n it.
PS0DX|Well I know with Arnold and Antony is Arnold's not so bad cos he uses his quite a bit er but the tendency with Antony is when the bill comes in each month th the rental is double what the usage is most of the time.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0E3|Oh we try and use ours as little as possible but still we've had high bills Where's the love.
PS0E2|In the drawer behind you.
PS0DX|Well I've switched my office phone over and well they actually wrote to me but I've switched mine over to this er discount if you do more than a hundred pounds worth a quarter.
PS0E3|Is it Mercury.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|No B T.
PS0E3|Oh.
PS0DX|Er B T.
PS0DY|Come on.
PS0E3|What is it a regular users'.
PS0DX|Yeah.
PS0E3|phone Yo you pay to.
PS0DX|Yeah the they've just brought it in.
PS0E3|you pay for the privilege then don't you.
PS0DY|Oh dear.
PS0DX|Well no don't pay for any privilege it's just that they've.
PS0E2|That's for for Antony.
PS0DX|that they've just discounted users But you can't I only get it on line one because line two I just use as an a as an incoming call line or if I'm caught on one and I want to ring out in the other at the same time I can use it.
PS0E3|Doug's got tha a goo a good system which is another new one It's it's part of the Star system But he he's got a two lines on one phone.
PS0DX|Mm.
PS0E3|and you only need a normal phone.
PS0DX|Mm.
PS0E3|er I suppose it's got one of those R buttons on.
PS0DX|Ah yes.
PS0E3|but it's now erm if the phone rings and he picks it up ah er and he's talking to someone on the phone someone else tries to ring.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0E3|erm it won't be engaged they will get a er er er a erm voice saying erm the caller is on another call at the moment please hold the line.
PS0DY|Mm.
PS0E3|and you hear o this er like three beeps and if you press the R it will hold wha the conversation you're on.
PS0DX|You're on an you can now go.
PS0E3|and you can speak to the other people and then you switch back.
PS0DX|Mm it's.
PS0E3|or hang up and then the phone will ring and you'll get the other who's.
PS0DX|Mm.
PS0E3|there It's quite clever.
PS0DX|But it could be annoying to the person holding on.
PS0E3|And they've got.
PS0DX|cos you've been answered so you start clocking up don't you at that point.
PS0E3|And they've got a call barring system as well as well I like that Erm say you ca you can tap in a code.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0E3|and that phone will be useless won't be able to ring out on it.
PS0DX|Yeah.
PS0E3|or you can ha tap another code in and it'll only make local calls and another code you can only make nationals.
PS0DX|Mm Mm.
PS0E3|er calls in this country and erm another code and it you.
PS0DX|Mm.
PS0E3|can phone anywhere you like all over the world.
PS0DX|Yeah Trouble is with this quarter with this discount I'm probably not going to get to a hundred pound at the office because I've been using it at home so much.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|But I now get er er er get an itemized bill from Telecom so I'll be able.
PS0E2|Yeah.
PS0DX|to re-charge on the basis of what's been charged.
PS0E3|So what happens say if you pho phone the dirty phone numbers.
PS0DX|Th that'll be on.
PS0DY|That's right.
PS0E3|You can you can find out.
PS0DX|Well I only did it out of curiosity basically to to see how much er one spent in in calls with th like Lyndsey in Hong Kong.
PS0E3|Yeah.
PS0DX|And I suppose it's almost.
PS0E3|Mind you that's pre I've only ever known that.
PS0DX|fifty percent of your phone bill on most occasions.
PS0E2|The only.
PS0E3|Only on.
PS0E2|unusual calls we.
PS0E3|on.
PS0E2|make are er itemized.
PS0E3|on normal phone bills but er the international calls international call they do.
PS0DX|Yeah Well it only gives you units used though.
PS0E3|Yeah.
PS0DX|it doesn't tell you the number it went to.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|And this does you see you get it with the number.
PS0E2|Do you know all that now.
PS0DX|It's quite interesting that where you think you've you've rung say Freda or Amber in the evening and you've had quite a lengthy conversation in mentally you think that.
PS0DY|Yeah.
PS0DX|and when the bill comes in you find it was only eighty six P or something like.
PS0E2|Yeah.
PS0DX|that.
PS0E2|You expect it to be more like three quid or something.
PS0DX|Yes tha that's right.
PS0E3|And do you know now from from Bournemouth erm.
PS0DX|That's er er Antony.
PS0E3|frequently used trunk calls.
PS0DX|there's some on the.
PS0E3|frequently used trunk calls.
PS0DX|Mm.
PS0E3|erm are not for example if you phone London from Bournemouth it's not the same band as if you phoned erm.
PS0DX|That's right.
PS0E3|Brighton from Bournemouth.
PS0DX|That's right There are.
PS0E3|because it's.
PS0DX|numbers there are areas.
PS0E3|Yeah.
PS0DX|now aren't there.
PS0E3|It's London Bristol Yeovil where else was it I wasn't really looking But not from.
PS0DX|Yes.
PS0E3|they don't do it from Banford for example that's.
PS0DX|Oh.
PS0E3|not the same exchange.
PS0DX|No.
PS0E3|It must be this new dish that's changed it must be I du n no Obviously some.
PS0DX|I was interested too that got the new phonebooks.
PS0E2|Mm.
PS0DX|at work and they got all the Mercury numbers in.
PS0E2|Yep.
PS0DX|as well.
PS0E3|Ours has got our mobile number in as well.
PS0DX|Has it.
PS0E3|Yeah And it don't cost any more.
PS0DX|No I know.
PS0E3|You could have one of the.
PS0E2|Oh it should have a Mercury numbers in cos all they actually do is rent a B T line and pay for it.
PS0DX|Yes I know yes.
PS0E2|So.
PS0DX|But th they they cheaper to use aren't.
