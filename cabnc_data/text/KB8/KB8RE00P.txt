PS14B|Doesn't sound very hopeful Does erm Bob er m know a lot about growing plants and things as well as vegetables.
PS15U|Oh yes he he.
PS14B|I'm looking I want somebody who knows something about gardening I'm trying to find out why one of our azaleas has turned up its toes.
PS15U|Albert over the road will be the best one to.
PS14B|Oh.
PS15U|tell you that cos he was erm erm school.
PS14B|Oh.
PS15U|grounds gardener He.
PS14B|I'll try.
PS15U|he would deal with shrubs more than Bob hasn't got a I mean he grows flowers and.
PS14B|I know.
PS15U|and things like that.
PS14B|yeah Thank you.
PS15U|Erm but erm I mean he nearly does know but I mean Albert is.
PS14B|Is it lit.
PS15U|Mm mm Albert is the gard he you know really good gardener Er I mean he shows.
PS14B|Well they're both in tubs they're both planted in ericaceous compost which is what we were told.
PS15U|Yeah.
PS14B|When we fed them before the winter we gave them proper er fertilizer for things that need acid soil.
PS15U|Mm mm.
PS14B|I know they can be affected by wind and frost and it turns the leaves brown and kills off the buds but why is only one affected And as soon as it's.
PS15U|Are they different kinds Or.
PS14B|No.
PS15U|are they exactly the same.
PS14B|They're the same kind exactly but they're different colours that's all They're both in they're both in wooden half barrels.
PS15U|But but don't azaleas don't azaleas shed their leaves.
PS14B|Erm I think some do but some are evergreen and these are evergreen.
PS15U|Oh Because I had one in the garden here and we moved it actually when we we took the er hedge out er to put the fence and the gate on er and we moved it somewhere else and it er it just died off Er but it used to er shed its leaves.
PS14B|Well yeah I think some do.
PS15U|And I think you're supposed to prune a little bit aren't you.
PS14B|They're not big enough to prune yet They're they're about er.
PS15U|But should you not prune them lightly to.
PS14B|eighteen inches.
PS15U|encourage new growth you see.
PS14B|No i it's er.
PS15U|Albert going past he's back and forwards to the garden.
PS14B|It said in the gardening book It didn't say much about them Really it's about you know huge erm rhododendrons it's only a little bit at the end of that But erm.
PS15U|I've got a book here.
PS14B|you know that er polythene that's got wire netting in between it like a like a wire netting sandwich with po with clear polythene on the outside We bent some of that round the windward side of the barrel.
PS15U|Oh right yes a sort of.
PS14B|and I and tied a lump of string round it to keep it on So it's been sheltered from the wind.
PS15U|Ooh unless the.
PS14B|We've made sure.
PS15U|cat's done something on it.
PS14B|Oh God next door's cats Er I thought I had one in the house yesterday I went as Sheila was going erm Jackie was in her garden.
PS15U|Oh yes.
PS14B|and I was telling her that that was the daughter-in-law of Mrs who lived there before.
PS15U|Owned the house originally.
PS14B|Graham did.
PS15U|Yes.
PS14B|and er I'd left the front door and the inner door open and.
PS15U|It don't switch off I'll have to go and do it.
PS14B|oh and er the cat was lurking around however it had gone somewhere else I can't.
PS15U|Oh gosh I've done it full.
PS14B|Oh never mind I'll drink half of it Yeah azaleas.
PS15U|It's a weak one anyway Ann.
PS14B|It just says where is it Lime-free soil plus large quantities of peat or leaf mould Some shade during the heat of the day Er it doesn't get any Erm when the sun's at the hottest anyway it's sheltered it only gets oh and the other thing is you er it it doesn't say here but you're supposed to it's supposed to be somewhere where they'll be sheltered from the early morning sun if there's been.
PS15U|Oh.
PS14B|a frost Oh we've had frost we haven't any early morning sun anyway Thank you.
PS15U|They said your azaleas reach five to eight feet it doesn't say does it.
PS14B|I gave it some water cos I.
PS15U|They might be different types you see One might.
PS14B|Yeah but.
PS15U|you see what I mean.
PS14B|I know it's it's just turning up its toes.
PS15U|Oh Dear dear.
PS14B|How much are car mats Paul.
PS15V|I think they're within the region of two quid each up to about five pound each.
PS14B|Mm I can afford that.
PS15U|Evergreen Azaleas Mostly small plants three to four feet high Is that what you've got.
PS14B|Yes they are small cos I got them.
PS15U|Small dark green leaves.
PS14B|to go in these half barrels.
PS15U|flowering prolifically May and June Mostly hybrids Forms of azalea Look for the hybrid flowering June July Exceptionally hardy but needing shade.
PS14B|Well it's against the garage wall.
PS15U|Mostly very hardy large flowers pink no pruning needed Propagated by layers.
PS14B|It said in my book just tidy them up if you you know if they needed a bit of tidying up.
PS15U|planting out No it doesn't say any more than that No it doesn't say.
PS14B|That's more or less what it said in my book except erm they need to be shaded from early morning sun if there's been a frost Well we've had plenty of frosts but there's been no early morning sun I know there's been wind.
PS15U|Oh there's been a lot of wind.
PS14B|but er.
PS15U|which probably is bad as a frost.
PS14B|Yeah.
PS15U|Have you got them in separate containers.
PS14B|Yes.
PS15U|Ah yes I think you told me.
PS14B|And the they're beside the garage facing towards the kitchen.
PS15U|Mm oh they're sheltered.
PS14B|and the sun always comes along the side of the house I can tell because me me washing always blows towards the gate to the back gate.
PS15U|Mm mm.
PS14B|right.
PS15U|Mm mm.
PS14B|Erm so that must be that's south over there isn't it.

PS15U|windows and is it the one er nearest the front that is.
PS14B|Yes.
PS15U|Oh yeah no.
PS14B|But it's only about er what's in between the two barrels Th the th you know that erm small cauldron with er primroses in.
PS15U|Mm.
PS14B|That's all that's separating them I mean they're close together.
PS15U|Yes but different plants respond differently to.
PS14B|and it's not big enough to shelter the other one and the other one looks perfectly healthy.
PS15U|Mm unless you've just got some disease.
PS14B|Good cup of coffee that.
PS15U|Eh.
PS14B|I said it's a good cup of coffee that.

PS15U|Well I tell him what kind of car it is.
PS14B|Yes.
PS15U|Erm.
PS14B|Well this is this is why I thought perhaps erm I didn't want to ask Jim too much or he would know I was buying them for him you see.
PS15U|That's right yes.
PS14B|And I remember this time in Winners when he he picked them up and looked at them and said I don't think these are the right ones for my car and that that's why I thought.
PS15U|They were too small you see weren't they.
PS14B|and I was thinking where on earth is there a shop in that sells sells things like that or do you have to go to a garage and I'd forgotten that that fruit.
PS15U|Yes.
PS14B|shop was one now.
PS15U|Yes it's it's very useful actually I've been up there buying things for him in the past when he was er operating the taxi and he hadn't time to go himself.

PS15U|goodness That would need some concentration.
PS14B|I I just sort of made erm two short ladders about two inches long.
PS15U|Oh right.
PS14B|I think I did it with a pair of tweezers to so I could stick the.
PS14B|matchsticks together and then I stuck one half on top of the other to make it look like an extending ladder.

PS14B|Yes I mean it.
PS15U|mhm.
PS14B|it doesn't need to be absolutely freshly cooked Yes No this is why I ca I don't know if you remember but erm she was interviewed by a reporter Fiona and she i when the market traders were all on strike and you know all those months the.
PS14B|er and there was only the two fruit stalls there.
PS15U|Yeah.
PS14B|and occasionally the fish st well.
PS15U|Yes.
PS14B|yes occasionally three fruit stalls and one fish stall she said er the market the market hadn't ceased trading trading it was perfectly healthy it was doing very well Cos I thought I.

PS15U|Yes.
PS14B|Sometimes a hundred.
PS15U|Mm mm.
PS14B|And er four stalls at the most there and according to her it was perfectly healthy and there was nothing wrong with it I thought and then I happened to go Jim came to carry the fruit and vegetables for me and when it had opened again and there was she with this I looked at Jim and I said ah That's why she said that she's got this jewellery stall.
PS15U|Oh I didn't know what stall type of stall she had I just read about it in the paper.
PS14B|I haven't had a proper look around the market for I looked.
PS15U|I went down.
PS14B|I looked at the buttons next to the fruit stall because what I usually do I go and get the fruit and vegetables if Jim's on the right shift he takes them home otherwise I buy them while it's quieter the man keeps them for me I go straight across the leisure centre to soft clay cos it's only open on Wednesdays and then on the way back one of them walks.
PS15U|Oh you put them in the pram.
PS14B|and I put the fruit and vegetables in the buggy and we come straight home cos it's time to eat by then.

PS15U|Oh dear He's not going to be very popular with her help at Oh he'll soon get out of it I mean they they settle down they settle down.
PS14B|Yes.
PS15U|I mean it's good for them learning to be amongst a lot of children and they soon learn that erm they can't have their way.
PS14B|Well her boys are quite amenable really but erm.
