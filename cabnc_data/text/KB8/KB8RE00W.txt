PS14B|Jim will you go and g what time does the off-licence shut.
PS14B|The Victoria Wine Cos it's where.
PS14C|Later isn't it Isn't it later.
PS14B|it's where I get my cigarettes from the Victoria Wine shop.
PS14C|this programme on And there's this to start with Er and Mo Mowlam that's why I watched it cos Mo Mowlam was on but anyway all these nurses getting twenty thousand a year staff nurses.
PS14B|No what he was talking about taxation.
PS14C|That's right.
PS14B|And that er they would be worse off because he said even staff nurses are getting more than twenty thousand pounds a year.
PS14B|Which of course charge nurses aren't getting anywhere near twenty thousand pounds a year and only a few erm nursing officers.
PS14C|Well it's nursing officers you have to get into that bracket if you get twenty thousand a year.
PS14B|Yes.
PS17G|Paul was er telling all these nursery rhymes nursery fairy stories rather.
PS14C|There's this there's there's there's Hague this Hague fellow who's a tory.
PS14B|Hague is a.
PS14C|you know so I rang up to Anglia television last night in the programme and objected to this.
PS14B|And of course he had the nurses' pay.
PS14C|this lie.
PS14B|scale in the other hand while he was ringing them Where's me purse.
PS14C|make an announcement but no announcement was made There was no announcement made at the end of the programme so and they never got back to me so I rang this morning first thing and last night they didn't ask me my name and address but this morning they did They got me name and address and telephone number at work and at home so I told the unions that they had to write in and complain about it too.
PS17G|Mm.
PS14B|There you are.
PS14B|Thanks.
PS14C|and er but what I mean.
PS14C|who was sitting in the audience who is a nurse and er would've known and she would've been trying to get in and say this is not true But she did ask a question she was the first question that was asked the one about erm.
PS14B|Yes but that's all very well but bout but er.
PS14C|it's too late then that's what A Angie said Angie said you know they they make this and it's too late you can't undo the the it's a lie.
PS14B|That's right So there's half the country thinking staff nurses are earning well over twenty thousand are owning earning over twenty thousand Your Pat said to me on Sunday while I was talking to her she said when she was saying oh well she doesn't know whether to vote Tory because.
PS14C|They've never been so well off.
PS14B|she's done quite well under them As Jim said in six months time if he's redundant she won't be feeling.
PS17G|Yes.
PS14B|the same.
PS17G|it's true.
PS14B|But she said I said oh.
PS14C|It was the La it was Will Owen and the Labour government that brought.
PS14B|I said oh Pat just just I said have you spoken to a nurse recently You know how demoralised they are and the state of the hospitals and things and she said oh well nurses er they they've always complained that they're hard up and.
PS17G|And they always have been.
PS14B|and the rest of it So talk some sense into her will you Just point out that they might be redundant and.
PS14C|Well if the Tories win I mean the privatization will really go to town I mean even the trusts The ambulance men in Northumberland because it's a trust and they're paid by the trust.
PS14B|That was another thing he said wasn't it.
PS14C|They they.
PS14B|That they privatized erm ambulance service they're now the highest paid in the country.
PS14C|Which is.
PS14B|and Jim Jim's got their pay scale and and.
PS14C|Well the trust paying them.
PS14B|They're being paid.
PS14C|less.
PS14B|they're being paid less than the N H S.
PS14C|Than than the N H S.
PS14B|ones.
PS14C|I mean just across if they go down to Durham which is an N H S ambulance service.
PS14B|And that's you know anybody listening to that on the television would think oh yes that's true You know it's it's.
PS17G|over there and you er believe everything they've said.
PS14B|once it's stuck in their head then it's like reading things in the newspapers.
PS14C|What what am I going for.
PS17G|Cigarettes.
PS14B|Er fort well if you if you manage to get to Victoria Wines in time er get me erm er twenty erm no get me forty er Emb what do they call them Elite please If you've got ta go to the Co-op just get me twenty of whatever's there is.
PS14C|Forty Elite.
PS14B|If you get to the Victoria Wine in time I don't know if he will I don't know if it shuts at fiveo'clock or what they do or if evening staff come on I've never tried to go after fiveo'clock.
PS17G|Mind you Ann I suppose that's why Pat got thinking about a Tory er vote.
PS14B|No she wasn't thinking well she wasn't exactly thinking about a Tory vote She said well I I don't know what to do she said I haven't read you know she hadn't read the election she hadn't had time to read the election addresses and she's not really interested in ac actually so she hasn't watched it on the television And I said oh Pat you don't want a Tory government in a again do you And she said well I I I don't know she said you know we've done alright under them What does she think's happening to education What does she think's ha happening to the hospitals.
PS17G|I don't think probably she hasn't really thought it she's she's been more concerned with her own self but she's can't I don't know I'll have to have a talk with her.
PS14B|Put your daughter straight.
PS17G|I've I've I've often thought I would never vote Tory but I mean I've been better off in some ways in that I was able to buy my council house But that as far as I can make out is the only thing that I've benefited by you know with them being in.
PS14B|Mm mm.
PS17G|erm.
PS14B|The unemployed certainly haven't been better off.
PS17G|The the thing is.
PS14B|The young people leaving school haven't been better off.
PS17G|Well it would be erm the number of people who are being put out of work.
PS14B|Yeah.
PS17G|and it's not just every week or every month it's every day when you hear of jobs being lost.
PS14B|That's right.
PS17G|It's a it's a.
PS14B|And isn't it a hundred hundred and hundred and fifty small businesses go bust every year I mean they keep saying we've given the all all these opportunities to all these.
PS17G|a case in point.
PS14B|small businessmen and there's a hundred and fifty.
PS17G|She tried to get she's tried to get started making doing her own business spoke to her the other day and she's well Pat spoke to her on Sunday and she got more out of her than I did.

PS14B|No Paul next door left school you know he cou all he wanted to be was a mechanic it's it's all he's ever been he's really good But he's learnt from his father.
PS17G|Mm mm.
PS14B|and he couldn't a job and then I me I mean he tried for apprenticeships all over the place and other jobs and he just couldn't get one When his father died when he was twenty- one he took over the erm taxi business Well it was private hire but most of the work came from Northgate Hospital.
PS17G|Mm mm.
PS14B|You know they they ran they took the nurses because the nurses home was a mile or was it a mile or a mile and a half or something from the hospital they had this they took them in the morning and then they took them at lunchtime and then all the different shifts coming on and off they took them and they had the schools run as well And then of course the er they started running down Northgate hospital and they closed down the nurses home So there was half his business worked out wiped out in one go And then erm his schools run was way up into the country quite a long way and then that was changed First of all th the erm registration went up then something else went up and then two of his children from farthest away were moving so he was gon na be paid much less than that Well the ordinary private hire there's so many of them I mean his dad had been doing it for years but there's so many started up.
PS17G|Yes.
PS14B|He couldn't compete And and then finally the council said he actually had an Austin Princess but you know Paul and his cars that that nineteen I don't know what it is the car he's got in his garage now but he buys old cars and completely rebuilds them it looks like a new car now and he ha he had an Austin Princess which which actually it was a P reg and er they told him he couldn't run the service unless he bought a much newer car And he couldn't do it because the pair of them I mean that was that business was supporting his mother as well and between them after they'd paid for the petrol they were taking in less than a hundred pounds a week and that was for the two of them.
PS17G|Two.
PS14B|So he couldn't keep it going any longer and he had to give it up so he's on the dole again It's about oh it's it's over a year since he packed in and he's tri applied for hundreds of jobs He's applied for jobs in Washington and.
