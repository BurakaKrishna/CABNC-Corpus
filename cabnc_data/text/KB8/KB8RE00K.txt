PS167|yeah.
PS14B|well they go up at the side of it and down behind it.
PS167|Down to the river.
PS14B|down and there's a path goes along and it comes it goes under the road bridge and it comes out at the foot bridge and it runs next to it.
PS168|Aha.
PS14B|the water got up to the second step from the top but when instead of turning right into my road if you'd keep straight on.
PS168|aha.
PS14B|and go along the river you know where the flood wall is.
PS168|yeah.
PS167|Mm.
PS14B|that's called Bennetts Walk Bennetts Walk was all flooded that was closed off.
PS167|mm.
PS14B|but that wasn't with flood water coming over that was because it was coming up the drains cos it couldn't drain into the river.
PS167|ah aha.
PS14B|so those houses were all sandbagged but it it got into some the problem was that the the road closed sign kept blowing down in the wind I tried to stand it up but it was oh so heavy I got it up but it it immediately blew down again and.
PS167|Well we went down.
PS14B|people couldn't see that it was water there.
PS167|Oh.
PS14B|sort of going just a short way along and having to reverse back out again.
PS168|I tell you how bad our one was it was all over the road this the the river line.
PS14B|mm.
PS167|at.
PS14B|from the.
PS167|goes up.
PS14B|some er when one of the.
PS167|where the court is where you used to play tennis.
PS14B|when the father of one of the children came.
PS167|it was right.
PS14B|he said has flooded.
PS167|oh.
PS14B|yeah.
PS167|and there's a house there I think it's a farm on the corner and they they always get it I mean.
PS169|When was this.
PS167|Last week with the rains.
PS14B|Thur er Wednesday and Thursday the children I have before and after school at Goose Hill School you know the one the one near me just the bottom of the road on the corner that's had to be closed on Thursday because the boiler room had flooded on Wednesday and er they had to dry it out and also the children from Newminster were told anyone living in the Middle Queens area go home.
PS167|And they closed that er school did they not I thought they sent them home cos the rains in.
PS14B|They must send them home at erm they must of sent them home about quarter to three because they got home at quarter past.
