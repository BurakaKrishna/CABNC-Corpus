PS14C|That's right Which is this next Friday.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|So I hope to sort it out the Lenten appeal well.
PS14B|The what.
PS14C|The Len.
PS14B|Lin.
PS14C|the Lenten's appeal at the schools that Mrs was supposed to let Miss know so she could get it off to the parents to get the money back so that they bought the scanner.
PS14B|See you didn't tell me about that.
PS14C|I did tell you.
PS14B|You didn't All you told me go on ah only this one's.
PS14C|Miss wanted to.
PS14B|all you told me was that Miss was retiring But I haven't to tell anyone Which I haven't done Which I don't intend to do.
PS14C|At the beginning of Lent Miss approached me.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|to see what she should do about the Lenten appeal.
PS14B|Aha.
PS14C|as she always does Since I said why send money to Great Ormond Street when there was plenty of children's things local.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|So I asked if we wanted anything And she said what about the bed at the Cottage Hospital.
PS14B|What good's a bed with no extra nurses.
PS14C|Well there are special beds.
PS14B|Oh you mean a bed Well.
PS14C|Tt.
PS14B|D' ya mean a special kind of mattress be.
PS14C|Well she just asked about a bed so I told her that we were.
PS14B|You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is But why's.
PS14C|She di na she just said a bed and so.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|I told her there were special beds that we have are very useful in fact very necessary in some some cases and are painfully short of them.
PS14B|Aha.
PS14C|And a Nimbas bed costs two thousand pound And there's another one on the market which I can't remember the name of which costs a lot more.
PS14B|Mhm.
PS14C|Something like five thousand But I can't remember the name Anyway I said I'd make enquiries as to what a is wanted And I said there's a there's a new children's ward will open at the Wandsbergh Hospital perhaps they would like something I saw Mrs and Mrs said they were aiming to raise money for the scanner appeal.
PS14B|Yeah.
PS14C|But also they're going to have a an obstetric adult patient's department at the College Hospital for the very first time.
PS14B|A what A.
PS14C|An obstetric outpatients.
PS14B|Yeah Yeah.
PS14C|and they're obviously they would be tend to be other children with mothers then so they would like perhaps a play facility there And other children who go to the E N T clinic and go to the.
PS14C|or just go to the outpatients in general and the casualty.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|there's very limited facilities for children to play So but I also coaxed Mrs about the Wandsbergh Anyway she wanted to me to go and see her she said there we there was a scanner appeal and she was also trying to talk about all sorts of other things that were possible and because there was an arts appeal and for arts facilities at the hospital and all sorts of things So I went back to Miss and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be she thought that that would be the best idea Not the children's things at the Cottage Hospital I also told her it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital and the children from will be invited to the hospital for that day that week sorry It's gon na be a week So she wanted to know what date it is So I I asked Mrs to but would she write to Miss and give her all the details And she said oh she'd be she'd be far better if she went to see and explained it all And that she was going on Wednesday I think Up she went you know.
PS14B|Hold on Which one was going to see which.
PS14C|It's.
PS14B|one.
PS14C|Mrs was going to see Miss.
PS14B|Was going to see Miss.
PS14B|Oh I see I didn't know which one.
PS14C|But I give them a so then I saw Mrs on Tuesday when I was at Ashington And she came up with all sorts of things that she would like for the the new Wandsbergh development But on a but there's nothing ready of course so th there's there's a giant sundial they're going to have in one of the courtyards and it's a giant one it's it's the the building and the blocks of things in in the in the courtyard that make up the the time So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the of the courtyard and it's eighto'clock and that one is nineo'clock and so forth This is just in a courtyard and there'll be shrubs and things so she's got.
PS14B|Hold on Wha how where is it going to be seen from.
PS14C|I presume it's seen from the wards that are up behind looking down onto this courtyard There's also erm a play area for the the children's ward there's also some murals on the the walls various artistic murals And of course they've got this grant from Artcan for six thousand pound for a proggie mat exhibition.
PS14B|A six thousand pound grant for a proggie mat.
PS14C|Well.
PS14B|exhibition.
PS14C|well over over a period it's and other things too but they sa they said that murals and proggie mats are involved in it And various other art things But also th the thought of a gar a garden and the children keeping the garden up But that's a apparently that was a long way and they have transport difficulties to go from here to the Wandsbergh Hospital But then I thought perhaps if that.
PS14B|I can't see the education committee with their lack of money paying for transport for children from here.
PS14C|Well they won't.
PS14B|to go Ashington Hospital to do a.
PS14C|they won't so the they they.
PS14B|garden.
PS14C|the the the education committee and the school governors have no money at all.
PS14B|No.
PS14C|to pay for that.
PS14B|I would expect.
PS14C|But then.
PS14B|that's a very low priority.
PS14C|well it isn't even a priority it is nothing They won't get the money Th they won't pay for them to go swimming.
PS14B|Well I don't.
PS14C|they've got ta walk to go swimming But I thought that now that the M S has acquired that bus and it's going to be standing around doing nothing for most of the time and it's a twenty nine seater bus I mean the seats come out so that wheelchairs can go in but in between times it's twenty seats you see.
PS14B|And then you'll need a P S V.
PS14C|Well.
PS14B|licence.
PS14C|but but that's that's that's easily remedied if you could get a er a driving licence holder to take them oh a volunteer driving licence holder among one of the parents or somebody who could take the children er periodically in the bus to visit the hospital to do this sort of thing So that was a possibility But I haven't seen Miss about all these sort of things But I did also say to Mrs that a new head would be appointed to take the imports from the first of September that it might be better to discuss it with them after I've discussed with Miss.
PS14B|I only know one person I only know one bus driver with children.
PS14C|There's ambulance drivers.
PS14B|And he got hi I think their children go to the Catholic School Er this letter from the Multiple Sclerosis.
PS14C|Yes Says any.
PS14B|that says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people You're not.
PS14C|To sixteen.
PS14B|you're not reducing the size of the bus.
PS14C|Well I think that's crazy.
PS14B|And someone who's been just used to driving a car are they going to be able to drive the huge long bus with no extra.
PS14C|Well.
PS14B|tuition.
PS14C|Well I I.
PS14B|Whether it's got whether it's got sixteen people in it or twenty nine.
PS14C|Well er.
PS14B|it doesn't alter the length of the bus.
PS14C|I drive the minibus at the hospital.
PS14B|I know.
PS14C|which only takes four wheelchairs and of course there's the drivers of of the minibus things that bring them I think I I would query that anyway that just.
PS14B|Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition.
PS14C|No.
PS14B|and just drive.
PS14C|But but.
PS14B|it.
PS14C|but I query as well whether just because you reduce the number of spa passengers in it that you you you don't need a P S V licence or the equivalent isn't a P S V licence but it's it's.
PS14B|Oh you do the they've looked into that.
PS14C|But it sounds doubtful to me But anyway there's the insurance point of view But anyway any I mean that's the easy and I mean if if people who are willing to drive can have experience in driving before they take passengers out I mean I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it without passengers.
PS14B|Yeah.
PS14C|I mean I I I I drove the minibus with only somebody in with me before I drove out with people in it.
PS14B|Didn't you da drive Dancy Dags.
PS14C|Oh yes I drove that but that was a long time ago that.
PS14B|Yeah but yo you drove that one.
PS14C|I drove it to Ashington and.
PS14B|Mm You drive her to Ashington in it.
PS14C|Yes.
PS14B|Erm do you think I should throw these roses out They're.
PS14C|Aha.
PS14B|dead aren't they.
PS14C|I'm afraid so.
PS14B|It's a shame.
PS14C|Well they'll be forced for last Sunday.
PS14B|Pardon.

PS14C|Have you decided where you want this umbrella tree.
PS14B|Er er.
