PS14B|Well I saw the curtains were down erm when I took the triplets.

PS14C|Even though the water was all down But erm.
PS14B|Have they done.

PS14B|Pardon.
PS14C|I don't like hot food ever.
PS14B|Oh I know you're like my mother stone cold.

PS14C|These folks and that with all these spices and things a you can't taste the food you taste.
PS14B|I know.
PS14C|the spices Cos that's what it was all about tas take away the taste of the rotten food that's the whole point of spices.
PS14B|I know I think it's hilarious Asdir erm saying my ginger wine was too hot.
PS14C|Was too hot.
PS14B|Bloody ridiculous.
PS14C|When she's used to eating red hot curries.
PS14B|But they don't drink red hot stuff I suppose I suppose that was the difference They don't drink red hot stuff they drink only eat red hot stuff and they drink cool things to cool their mouth down after.
PS14B|She drinks tea.
PS14C|Yeah.
PS14B|Well she she used to drink tea when she if I ever well I didn't invite her in for a coffee do well I didn't to begin with did I.

PS14B|I mean.
PS14C|not drink coffee.
PS14B|No I invite when we walk back from school erm when she first came to live round there and er I used to walk back from school with her sometimes and say would you like a cup of coffee Well she didn't know anybody of course and she'd say no thank you And then after oh after a few weeks she said I'll come in for a cup of tea So I said okay So I used to make tea for her And it got in the end actually if I was if I had to do something that was urgent or I had to go somewhere I used to have to say to her something like you know erm oh I better get on I got a lot to do this morning or I'm goi I've to be shopping and be back in time to cook Jim's dinner or something like that cos he's starting oh I've got ta have his dinner ready at twelve before he goes to work and if I really was pushed otherwise she would have come in every day Not that I minded her coming in every day just didn't not always that time.
PS14C|Aye I wonder how they're getting on through there.
PS14B|And also if she came in when I had the triplets it meant that erm you know she was sitting talking to me when I wanted to be playing with them and taking them out and getting on with doing things with them.
PS14C|They still haven't sold the house have they.
PS14B|No Well I was just talking about that today to Betty You ar di didn't you see it Didn't you show someone round it once.

PS14B|and er I went her mother and father were with her and I just really went in up and down the stairs and they went upstairs and they they shouted oh Ann Come and look at this And er in the back I think it was the back bedroom there was a a light switch and the wiring was sort of hanging from from the switch It looked dangerous.
PS14C|Mm.
PS14B|And there was there was something weird It wasn't a telephone point I don't know what it was.

PS14B|and after about ten minutes I thought what the devil is she doing in there No she only had the three children erm Asthana wasn't born That was it.

PS14B|Oh They moved before Christmas.
PS14C|I know it's two Christmases.
PS14B|Aye Well whatever And er well that might have been it A Asthana might have been a tiny baby So I went along there cos I thought if she was painting the children will be frozen and nothing to sit on and no.
PS14C|Mm mm.
PS14B|heating So I went down and she was she was painting the bathroom ceiling And I said er I'll take the children back to my house with me at least they'll be warm I can give them a drink or something So they came back but of course if it's jus if it's been pouring in on that bathroom ceiling again it's it when I took when Elsie called up to me come and look at this the bathroom ceiling was black mould.

PS14B|Well do you want to go take some of the other patients that day and I'll go as an escort.
PS14C|Well on the twelfth of June my Age Concern are having er a fair at Blagden Hall all day that day.

PS14C|The twelfth of July So on Hazel's birthday No that's twelfth of June.
PS14B|Twelfth of June your Hazel's birthday.
PS14C|What's the twelfth of July.
PS14B|I've no idea.
PS14C|It's the twelfth of July is last year the er.
PS14B|Fourth of July's Independence Day.
PS14C|it's the twelfth of July of last year they had one No that's the fourteenth of July.
PS14B|I don't think anything's the twelfth of July.
PS14C|No It's the fourteenth of July is Bastille Day But anyway.
PS14B|And what are you that day.
PS14C|I'm on early All earlies.
PS14B|Ordinary early Quarter past three early.
PS14C|Oh well I say I'm on early but I will be I could be an early or a late So that's.
PS14B|So if you took them that day you'd be going while you were on duty.
PS14C|Well for pa most of it or part of it But I could organize that And if what they call it.
PS14B|Is that a Sunday at Easter.
PS14C|It's a Sunday If they can actually let me know whether that bus is available or not.
PS14B|You're not gon na drive that bus are you.
PS14C|I didn't say I was But Mr has got a P S V licence I don't know if I can drive.
PS14B|Oh.
PS14C|the bus or not it depends we'll have to see.
PS14B|And does he does he drive the buses Er the hospital bus like.
PS14C|No.
PS14B|that.
PS14C|No No He's never driven He's not down as a as a driver for the minibus now But he's got a P S V licence which is a different thing altogether.
PS14B|Yes but if he was willing to drive in his spare ta time he would have his name down surely Wouldn't he.
PS14C|Well one would have thought so but I said to er Mrs you see about the minibus no not the minibus the M S bus being available and I said the problem was or maybe that we'd have to have drivers who have had a P S V licence or what they call it It isn't a P S V license now it's very different type of licence.
PS14B|Well whatever it's called.
PS14C|But it's the same thing.
PS14B|Yeah.
PS14C|And she said oh my husband's just renewed his So he could drive and so there'd be no problem she says But he's never ever as far as I know offered to drive the minibus.
PS14B|Does he work.
PS14C|Well.
PS14B|It sounds it sounds odd saying oh my husband's just renewed his it makes it sound as if he hasn't had a P S V erm licence for a while.
PS14C|I don't know.
PS14B|Cos if he was working and driving he wo it surely he would have automatically renewed it.
PS14C|I don't know.
PS14B|So it sounds as if he's just renewed it after a while.
PS14C|They used to have some sort of test on that.
PS14B|So maybe that's why he's never volunteered before If he didn't have the licence he couldn't.
PS14C|Well yes of course.
PS14B|Except he could have for the minibus of course Where's my knitting gone.
PS14C|I think he had a pet shop.
PS14B|Well he wouldn't need a P S V licence for a pet shop.
PS14C|But I don't know that he does now.
PS14B|Unless you were a Pet Shop Boy and were a roadie.
PS14C|Mm mm.
PS14B|I can't remember what line I was doing.
PS14C|Well because she periodically brings the bird seed for the the bird on the ward I'm sure he never Whether the business was successful or not I had a vague recollection somebody said he had this pet shop at Blagden or som not Blagden er.
PS14B|Blagden There are no shops.
PS14C|not Blagden.
PS14B|at Blagden.
PS14C|Bury.
PS14B|Oh.
PS14B|Mhm.
PS14C|But we could still take the minibus and just take three or four.
PS14B|Yeah.
PS14C|Well that's an alternative But that will be a good day to go out on.
PS14B|Mm mm.
PS14C|But we could take my mother on the other one.
PS14B|Yeah.
PS14C|Or we could take them periodically Could go out well the next then there's a queue a mile long I said no I said mark the ones on that thing you want to go to That's when I.
PS14B|It's a bit far to take her to near Berwick.
PS14C|I wasn't thinking of taking her there I was thinking of taking you.
PS14B|Oh.
PS14C|Anyway it might be too cold.
PS14B|And Corn Hill on the Tweed's a bit far for you my love.
PS14C|I was thinking about.
PS14B|There's Anwick.
PS14C|cos you.
PS14B|Howick at Anwick.
PS14C|I was thinking of you going there.
