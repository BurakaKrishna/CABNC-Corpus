PS15S|Well erm the only.
PS14B|So I I do not jump on any more.
PS15S|the only trouble with that sort of thing i is again if you ever get any wet on it because.

PS14C|So the mayor's taking out the oranges.

PS15S|No I don't suppose thank you Er.
PS14B|Do you work.
PS15S|No.
PS14B|Mm.
PS14C|No erm basically er I think for the anyhow Trevor will be coming in so we'll we just st try and stay a little more to see what happens at the end.
PS15S|But erm.
PS14C|See they handed it over to us and but they didn't wan na you know it was very when what they call them Erm.
PS15S|It was Temple wasn't it la last year.
PS14C|Aye Temple was but it it was a good job because we had no oranges and they had to go and break in.
PS15S|It's alright now.
PS14C|Yeah.
PS14B|Was that the year the oranges were horrible.
PS14C|Er.
PS14B|I've.
PS15S|Yeah.
PS14B|they were Seville oranges I'm sure they were.
PS14C|Well they've they've been nice.
PS14B|Seville oranges.
PS15S|Aye.
PS14C|They've never been really nice.
PS15S|Yeah Well I don't know where they're getting them from but I mean that's what they say.
PS14B|Well that year.
PS15S|And they've got Round Table laid on to help and they want help from the from us So they want us to go around at half past one or the two of them can start cos we've got an addition.
PS14C|Well it worked Er I'm just wondered you know wi with because they came to expect it and we we didn't know And they'd handed it over to us and then obviously they wanted it back but then.
PS15S|Well I think it's like everything else I think that er with with Lawrence being off they're just sort of meeting everything as a crisis and getting getting.
PS14B|Well if you're at work.
PS14C|Yo you see as well to go with what you call them.
PS14C|Er.
PS14C|he he.
PS15S|Didn't.
PS14C|he didn't want anything to do with it you see That's where and he's not from he's not from this end so had er no real interest for him I don't think.
PS14B|If you're at work Dorothy could go If I help I'll help with Trevor with his triplets.
PS14C|Well you can go and get their oranges and the.
PS14B|Yes but it's he he couldn't possibly push that buggy.
PS14B|around that field.
PS14C|But it isn't in the fields though.
PS15S|it's up beside the.
PS14C|It's it's.
PS15S|it it's Carlisle Park.
PS14B|Oh That's.
PS14C|Because.
PS14B|better.
PS14C|because the the the pa the er.
PS14B|Oh Because of that lea.
PS14C|The Easter Field is is.
PS14B|leaking.
PS15S|It's got a.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|So it can't be used.
PS14B|Right.
PS15S|But I presume that we do turn out if we do it right in the middle.
PS14C|Well in actual fact people who turned out were Isobel and me and er what they call him Er one who goes on Er from Lonsdene Er Fred.
PS14B|Fred.
PS14C|No Fred.
PS15S|No Jack's not very well.
PS14B|Well I helped you one year.
PS14C|Oh yes.
PS14B|cos there was only.
PS14C|Yes.
PS14B|there was only you and somebody else.
PS14C|Well the year I was chairman Th the er the year I was wi I was chairman we were both there.
PS14B|There was one child came up about seventeen times.
PS14C|Oh yes.
PS14B|I think.
PS14C|Erm down it was down here remember.
PS15S|I know.
PS14C|That was the year the oranges were horrible maybe his mother was making marmalade.
PS15S|The only thing about er is that the Rotaract one tentatively mentioned about the.
PS14C|Well that's it I mean th tha when we took it over we we got that cos people said well you know just dishing out the oranges wasn't there should be something organized so Rotaract said they would do we said we would give the money towards the prizes.
PS15S|So that they wouldn't hate us Well when er the the the there's two words the charter and what's the other word There's two things to do with.
PS14C|Food and jar that's right.
PS14B|Yeah.
PS15S|Well well Barlen Barlen.
PS14C|Barlen and.
PS15S|Yeah Yeah.
PS14B|I can't say that properly Those words aren't used where I come from.
PS15S|And er er.
PS14B|Mind I use words that Jim doesn't.
PS15S|the the Rotaract er presents this year that they're towards so he's been quite pleased.
PS14C|Mhm.
PS15S|So they'll they'll be done And Round Table it says has laid on for the.
PS14C|Well Round Table a er have never that's the first time then We got.
PS15S|Well it's.
PS14C|because cos it's Rotaract who's always.
PS15S|It must be the borough involved with the.
PS14C|Mhm.
PS15S|But I'm er.
PS14C|But they were keen I mean I they they've they've they did work didn't they With with the games and things when when we were there.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|And it was a reasonable day too.
PS14B|I know all the children.
PS14C|I mean we thought it'd rain this year so it's more.
PS15S|Yeah.
PS14C|likely to be a better day then.
PS14B|And ee all the kids ended up with a prize didn't they.
PS14C|Oh eventually yes I mean th the.
PS14B|Yeah they.
PS14C|they were that had bigger to ones.
PS14B|The winners got.
PS15S|Who supplied those then.
PS14C|Out of the money that we gave them.
PS15S|Oh The.
PS14B|Yes.
PS15S|I see it was and that was what Rotaract did.
PS14C|Yes Yes.
PS14B|They had big eggs well you know sort of the.
PS15S|Aha.
PS14B|Smarties type egg so about so big.
PS14B|for the prizes.
PS15S|Ah.
PS14B|and the others got little Cadbury's.
PS15S|Ah.
PS14B|Creme Eggs Which remi reminds me I've got to get some for all they spare children before.
PS15S|Yes well.
PS14B|before they ran out.
PS15S|It's surprising actually cos th the more the more common ones do run out because of course th the other ones are a bit pricey.
PS14B|The blooming Creme Eggs are on sale all the year round and then they run out at Easter That's happened I couldn't get any one year I took the triplets to the erm Goose Hill coffee morning in the Town Hall and I gave them all money for the tombola and one of them won a Creme Egg.
PS14B|but I persuaded him that it would melt while he had his drink and to put it in my bag and er it was lunchtime when we got home and we were going some I I can't remember what we were doing afterwards so I gave it to his mother I thought she could share it.
PS14B|Mind by the time you'd shared a Creme Egg between those three and their older brother.
PS15S|Yeah There's not much of it left.
PS14B|No but I could have seen a there'd be an almighty tantrums from the other two if Ji er.
PS15S|Aha.
PS14B|James had had it.
PS15S|I can imagine.
PS14B|Mm Mm.
PS14C|Is there anything much for the agenda for a week on Tuesday.
PS15S|Not a great deal I mean what I'll.
PS14C|Yeah.
PS15S|do is we'll get rid of those couple of things left over.
PS14C|Mhm.
PS15S|and er basically it's Peter's got the one coming which is er put the ducks in the river.
PS14C|Mm.
PS15S|Er he's doing the a and what I'm er sug suggesting.
PS14C|Aha.
PS15S|like well apparently the fella that's done it for years and years for years for years has had a.
PS14C|Mhm.
PS15S|and he's he's just ke you know what I mean I think he's he's getting an extension so that's why there's a bit of delay on that.
PS14C|Mhm.
PS15S|And it's where that lot meet.
PS14B|I've been counting them since.
PS14C|Well how much I mean.
PS14B|I read the letter in the paper.
PS14C|how much was he paying.
PS15S|It was summat like er I du n no it was summat like five hundred pound a year It was quite modest.
PS14C|Mm.
PS15S|Er.
PS14B|There were thirteen.
PS14C|But.
PS14B|drakes cha er chasing one duck er just past the baths along the promenade And then we sat at the far side of the Old Gate bridge and er an old lady came along and said and she was counting them but she said just look at that thing she counted seven although in actual fact by then th these dra the seven drakes had stopped cha chasing the duck and they were all sitting down And a there was a domestic one in each group there was one along near the baths in among the thirteen and there was another white one near Old Gate Bridge.
PS14C|Did he cull them as well.
PS15S|Yeah apparently so.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|Did he feed them Cos there's there was there used to be fe feed put down for that as well.
PS15S|Well to be honest it seems to I Peter's got the details cos he's been talking to er the public health clerk.
PS14C|Mhm.
PS15S|But it's it's it's it sort a it's I think carrying through from the old borough days.
PS14C|That's right.
PS15S|and somebody ha erm nobody really knew a great deal about it so I think he's been doing some research on that That's the one paper that is a bit er maybe a bit so but th I'll have to check with the N R A because of course er the river.
PS14C|Mm.
PS15S|er policing is their responsibility.
PS14C|It is.
PS15S|They they've not they'll not do that.
PS14C|No.
PS15S|No But I mean we really we've got ta make sure that they haven't got any objections But of course in the meanwhile of course we've had a flood.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|And it's going to kill most of the.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|eggs wash most of the nests away I was thinking yesterday.
PS15S|It's bloody incredible actually We always get extreme.
PS14C|Well that's it wasn't a obviously as high as the flood twenty seven years ago.
PS15S|No.
PS14C|But was pretty near It was getting near But of course the higher standards they've got no protection cos they didn't want what was offered.
PS15S|They didn't want a bank.
PS14C|Well that's right.
PS15S|Er none whatsoever.
PS14C|It was.
PS14C|a raised footpath that was before.
PS15S|Yeah.
PS14C|this wasn't it Than than the bridge right round.
PS15S|Which is what we're doing at at the Wandsbeck in n it So we'll put a we'll put a bank in very deliberately at the first level.
PS14C|Mhm.
PS15S|erm and went right the way through with it did look it doesn't look bad at all it was.
PS14C|Yeah well no it didn't I mean this looks well there's nothing else they could do here It doesn't look il ugly but I mean it it it's not attractive.
PS15S|No.
PS14C|but it's.
PS14C|but but but they've got protection.
PS15S|But I mean er that one lent itself to that.
PS14C|That's right Yes.
PS14B|Yes.
PS14C|It would have been ideal.
PS15S|But you see now of course that was when there were River.
PS14C|Yeah.
PS15S|River Authority days and.
PS14C|Yeah.
PS15S|that was quite good Erm it was quite useful er they you could get things done now.
PS14C|Mm.
PS15S|now it's nothing.
PS14C|Well they just put.
PS14B|I came along the river path when I came home from shopping Sitting in the the sand damp sand under the bridge.

PS14C|there's nothing can be done than the.
PS14B|No.
PS14C|nothing at all.
PS14B|Mhm.
PS15S|Mhm.
PS14C|But er ah you know it gets up into the garden but I don't think it it's got anywhere near the house er this time cos I was up there on Thursday and I you could see where it had been but it was and I mi I'd have got very worried about er.
PS15S|But you could actually put a bag all the way and tie it into tie it into er the it's the Skillery Bridge that one.
PS14C|Yes the Skillery Bridge.
PS15S|And.
PS14C|yeah.
PS15S|you just sort of tied up the.
