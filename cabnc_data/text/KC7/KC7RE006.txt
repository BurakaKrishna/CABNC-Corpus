PS0BK|No I know what you mean I've never really found it that much of an insult ever anyway but I just think that it's a bit of a term which doesn't really apply to us Do you know what I mean We've got hippyish tendencies but we're not hippies.
PS0BL|Well also I mean the term hippy I mean it's not really a real term I don't think Shall I put a bit more do you reckon that's enough that's okay that little bit of sauce in n it Do you reckon there's enough there.
PS0BK|Is Nancy eating.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|Er er er er er well what else could you put in that would make it more.
PS0BL|More more tomatoes and more tuna.
PS0BK|I might I would maybe think it might be worth making a little bit more actually.
PS0BL|Right Shove it all in Do you wan na chop mu mush that up a bit.
PS0BK|Okay But then I'm pretty shit at measurements and stuff cook the dinner.
PS0BL|Well what's left I can have tomorrow Erm in that case are these this stuff here is it yours.
PS0BK|What stuff.
PS0BL|This stuff.
PS0BK|No It might be Frank's or someone's.
PS0BL|I reckon it is Or Na.
PS0BK|Oh she won't mind you using it anyway She's got so much tuna she could bloody start an aquarium up.
PS0BL|tuna.
PS0BK|Mind you they're all dead so it wouldn't be a very active aquarium really would it Think the pasta's done.
PS0BL|Right do you wan na turn it off then.
PS0BK|Do you wan na taste it to check cos I might've got it wrong No I think it's done actually what am I talking about I have got a brain I can make decisions I'm a graduate.
PS0BL|Another thing I I've realized recently right I I have a brain I can make decisions I have an opinion.
PS0BL|that can be valued by people.
PS0BK|I've always valued your opinion.
PS0BL|Yeah I know you have but anyone else has.
PS0BK|Do you mean straight.
PS0BL|Yeah yeah basically.
PS0BK|You know I'd never really valued the the erm the truth in that term straight heads do definitely think very differently Andy's a real mate he just kept saying straight heads er for all the times when I might have said oh I couldn't really talk to some people last night and he'd say what you mean straight heads he's right Totally different wavelength man.
PS0BL|It's not just I don't well I d I don't think it's.
PS0BK|No it's not just straight heads but like quite a lot of the time it is straight heads.
PS0BL|I think the thing is people who are very straight aren't likely to people who are like very limited in their m their way of thinking.
PS0BK|Probably maybe a bit of a chicken and egg situation and the egg might have come before the chicken.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|Yeah Funny way of putting it Deep in my heart safe from the guards.
PS0BL|Is there lots of space at the table.
PS0BK|Er I can make some space is it nearly dinner time.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|I'll open the wine then.
PS0BL|Let the wine breathe It's really funny right erm in the office today this guy Paddy got a er a an an invitation like a formal invitation to erm a posh do.
PS0BL|and erm he he was trying to work out how how to write the reply correctly And he asked this girl er.
PS0BK|Can you say that again sorry.
PS0BL|This guy Paddy in the office.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BL|he had an invitation to a posh do you know a black tie type of thing.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BL|A for a formal invitation.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BL|and he wasn't sure like how what was the correct way to reply to it right.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BL|And so he asked this girl Jane and and then he asked me and erm and er had I sat down and thought about it I could have said well er what I thought you know the correct way er but I thought well there's correct and there's correct and I think the right way is to write to it and to say yes thanks.
PS0BK|No there is actually a very formal way of doing it though isn't there There's I see what you mean there's correct and correct.
PS0BL|Oh yeah yeah but I I but I just thought so I so I so I so I said to him well I if it was me I'd just write back and say thanks yes I'll come actually thank you very much.
PS0BL|cos I thought what you talk about is such a load of bollocks and he looked at me madly and I thought oh how funny I thought I'm gon na have to start explaining myself to people a bit more actually.
PS0BL|cos they get very they misunderstand me.
PS0BK|Yeah but I mean it doesn't really matter if they misunderstand you does it But I mean I know what you mean I a lot cos I remember erm when Claire was I got a really formal invitation to something and I asked Claire how you were supposed to reply and she told me the exact wording of how you should reply and I just looked at her I looked at her and I said I'm not bloody writing that Cos it sounded so stiff and so er.
PS0BK|Cheers lovely.
PS0BL|alright.
PS0BS|Oh dear.
PS0BS|Good job.
PS0BL|I mean the whole point of it is right is it doesn't make any difference how you reply to an invitation.
PS0BK|Well I know I mean especially if you know the people what's the point of being formal if you know the people.
PS0BL|Exactly.
PS0BK|It's so ridiculous.
PS0BL|with with posh people if th if they were being pissed off by the fact that you didn't reply to the invitation properly then he's a dickhead.
PS0BL|people.
PS0BK|Did you even try Did you even try to get it out or did you just think oh well.
PS0BK|Oh what That wasn't doing what I was asking it to do I wanted it to forward wind I think I pressed the wrong button I've got I did have the other one Crossroads but the reason why I had it was because Dave was in the house and he had it.
PS0BS|Right right yeah.
PS0BK|And then he fucked off and left me and he didn't give me I di this it really pisses me off the way that people like leave before you get round to taping the tapes that you liked do you know what I meanD' ya know what I mean.

PS0BL|it's a it's for the students for God's sake I mean they shouldn't be making like more hassles.
PS0BS|They are basically real.
PS0BK|This is what pisses me off so often you know things like the halls of residence and stuff are there to help the students and they don't they just try and rip them off for every cent they can do it for.
PS0BS|Yeah They er I mean in in Handsworth right on this bottom corridor the boys' bottom corridor it is in such a bad way you know like they keep erm like putting their fists through windows and things like that and the amount of repairs and fining Like th what they did one time they all had erm.
PS0BK|What just cos they're all yobs.
PS0BS|Yeah They all had something one night and erm er.
PS0BK|I wouldn't bother Nance we're all gon na get.
PS0BS|a vegetable.
PS0BK|done anyway.
PS0BS|a nice vegetable.
PS0BK|Yeah was it fungus by any chance.
PS0BS|Yeah yeah they were having.
PS0BS|fungus one night.
PS0BL|Do you want does an does anyone want some of this bread because it is really nice and it's not.
PS0BS|Mm I'd like half.
PS0BL|it's not er it's not all horrible It's nice and.
PS0BS|Anyway yeah they had this this fungus and erm they they kicked down a door and erm got extremely extremely energetic and like put like erm er er er in this store it was a storeroom and they'd put things like the projectors and erm er catering equipment.
PS0BK|And in this door was what.
PS0BS|In this store.
PS0BK|Oh yeah.
PS0BS|It was a door to a storeroom and inside this store there was all video equipment catering equipment.
PS0BK|Oh dear.
PS0BS|and they put it in the sinks and baths all round the hall.
PS0BK|And turned taps on.
PS0BS|No they didn't turn the taps on they just left it all round the hall and and the door frame had been kicked off and all things like this you know.
PS0BK|Oh dear Did they get caught.
PS0BS|Well the people that done it didn't get caught but the corridor on which it happened was fined for all the equipment.
PS0BL|Oh.
PS0BS|A lot of money.
PS0BK|So did the people on the corridor know who it was.
PS0BS|Yeah.
PS0BK|Only they they they must be f mad with them.
PS0BS|Yeah They're obviously not gon na say anything but they are very mad.
PS0BK|They should get them to pay for it.
PS0BS|I know Well I think they are going to the people that did it tt are gon na pay for it anon er anonymously.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BS|via the er hall inhabitants you know that can not afford it.
PS0BK|Yeah So at least they won't get done for it cos they'd probably go up to disciplinary and stuff wouldn't they.
PS0BS|that on.
PS0BL|Mm.
PS0BK|Erm lordy lordy I remember that we we had erm a corridor fine in our hall for er just something stupid like they one of the ceiling tiles got broken or something But we w did you have to pay a deposit It came out of our deposit.
PS0BS|we did fifty pounds.
PS0BK|Mm.
PS0BS|That's true I should get that back shouldn't I.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BS|Mm there's no reason why I shouldn't get that deposit back.
PS0BK|No.
PS0BS|Because last.
PS0BK|And that's why they've mentioned it isn't it.
PS0BS|Yeah.
PS0BK|Cos with us getting it back was automatic I think you were in a shitty hall Nance.
PS0BS|I know.
PS0BK|What what happened about your posters They just walked in and saw that you had posters up and.
PS0BS|Yeah the cleaners you know the cleaners have got a key to your room and that and you.
PS0BK|What cos you'd used Blu Tak or something.
PS0BS|Yeah Oh basically you weren't allowed anything up on any wall.
PS0BL|Well we weren't supposed to have posters up in our hall either.
PS0BK|Really.
PS0BL|Mm.
PS0BS|And erm y every time the cleaners came round on a Tuesday it's not ev er everything had to be on the bed including chairs er everything you know you had to have your desk.
PS0BK|My cleaner used to come in and I'd be in bed And she used to clean round me and stuff.
PS0BS|Cos our cleaners won't clean if it's erm occupied or not everything is cleaned from the floor they won't change the bed sheets unless you've actually taken them off and.
PS0BK|We're oh no we didn't they didn't do that for us either.
PS0BL|Well we we had that We had to erm like have you wouldn't you wouldn't.
PS0BK|No.
PS0BL|wouldn't get bed sheets unless they were actually stripped off the bed things like that.
PS0BS|Mm.
PS0BK|But I I me and Claire by the time we left U H had a store of bed sheets to bring to our new house Just because like they'd leave them for us and we hadn't changed them And we'd just shove them on under the bed and stuff I had thousands I mean I gave a load back cos I had loads of them And the reason why they were shoved under the bed was because I hadn't got round to sort of you know doing anything about it sort of thing.
PS0BL|Mm Mm.
PS0BK|But I mean my cleaner used to come in and just sort of like clean around me and chat a bit Dave's cleaner in High Hall used to do loads of stuff for him she used to wash his mugs up and all sorts of things.
PS0BS|Mm Mm They do in the self catering flats But erm.
PS0BK|I'm gon na try a bit of your bread.
PS0BS|they're really funny and finicky about a lot of things you know It does my head in And basically they ha and the other thing right I found out what they had for dinner the other night right We had jacket potatoes right which is literally mouldy and baked hard so you'd get about out of a jacket potato you'd probably get about that much potato and the rest is just skin and mould and hardness quiche which is just like processed cheese and processed eggs and everything you can imagine just total packet mix.
PS0BK|Mm.
PS0BS|it tastes like blancmange rather than quiche.
PS0BL|Mm.
PS0BS|and erm salad which is just like brown lettuce And y and I was paying eighteen pounds a week to be catered for.
PS0BK|Wh why doesn't someone do anything about it.
PS0BS|Apparently.
PS0BK|Like take it to N U S or something.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|Because that is just a pile of shit.
PS0BS|We're not even.
PS0BK|they're ripping everybody off in that hall.
PS0BS|we're not even in it we've de-affiliated from erm.
PS0BK|Oh that's that's why it's in that basically that's why.
PS0BS|Oh.
PS0BK|people that's why erm N U S is there to protect man.
PS0BS|And nobody Handsworth is in a funny neck of the woods basically it's like off campus it's university accommodation.
PS0BK|Miles away.
PS0BS|miles away off campus you know they haven't got to make it look good.
PS0BL|So you haven't got you haven't got any any back up kind of from the.
PS0BS|No.
PS0BL|campus the whole campus feeling I guess is.
PS0BS|Yeah yeah.
PS0BL|Mm.
PS0BS|It is it's sort of like it's sort of like extradited from the rest of the er the rest of the whole university you know nobody really cares about what goes on at Handsworth But it's like wherever I you know if you get a halls of residence on campus you would get put in Handsworth like if you chuck a telly out of the like one.
PS0BK|It's like a prison isn't it.
PS0BS|Yeah It's like you know.
PS0BK|Or a rehabilitation centre.
PS0BS|Yeah But it hasn't got anything going for it basically whatsoever.
PS0BK|Mm.
PS0BS|it's got three tvs though which are really rubbish and one small bar called The Bin Village Inn it's called and it is absolutely tiny and really crap.
PS0BK|Mm.
PS0BS|Very expensive as well It's more expensive than on campus I mean we haven't got a pub there we haven't got like the Guild bars or anything like that.
PS0BK|It's worse than being on Griffin Close.
PS0BS|Because there's no erm there's no like for freshers there wasn't any sort of entertainments during freshers' week on at Handsworth it was all at campus.
PS0BK|Mm So how how do you get in to campus then Do you is there one bus that goes all the way in.
PS0BS|One bus the sixteen but it's like twenty minutes it's like catching the bus from Moseley erm Village.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BS|from here You have to walk that far like to get the bus and then get in and then walk back home it's not too far.
PS0BK|But do they erm provide a minibus service.
PS0BS|No no there's no.
PS0BK|to get back.
PS0BS|no minibus service at all erm at any time of the day or night and they erm.
PS0BK|Cos we used to have like this minibus service back from the Guild.
PS0BS|Mm.
PS0BK|even if you weren't in hall and like girls used to get priority.
PS0BL|Mm.
PS0BK|You could hire out free rape alarms and all that kind of stuff.
PS0BL|yeah you hand your railcard over and get.
PS0BK|Yeah free rape alarm That is just so shit but a lot of that is to do with the fa is A the whole of Aston disaffiliated from the Guild from the N U S.
PS0BS|The whole university is.
PS0BK|When did they do that Do you know.
PS0BS|Last year I think.
PS0BK|That is just I just don't understand why universities do that it's so fucking stupid Cos that means that you can't get things like.
PS0BS|apparently I was talking to like cos you know a lot of my lecturers.
PS0BK|erm like student cards and stuff cos that was all.
PS0BS|Mm I know.
PS0BK|th no you can but all student cards and stuff are all negotiated by N U S.
PS0BS|I know And the N U S you know it is in a way it is a good thing but in a way it isn't because when they were actual when they actually belonged to the N U S erm they weren't get because it's a small university they weren't getting much funding from the us er the N U S or erm any support really I mean it's just like Aston is it is is it's it's a university but it hasn't been a university for that long it was a technological institute before.
PS0BK|Mm.
PS0BS|it's only been a university now for about sort of ten year well not even that five or ten years I think.
PS0BK|Mm.
PS0BS|And before it was sort of like the tech it was mainly erm sort of post graduate retr er sort of training centre for sort of science erm science graduates.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BS|and things like that and it only it's only become and really it's only actually set up as a business school quite recently as well I mean what in the past ten years or something.
PS0BK|Mm.
PS0BS|as well Erm my course has only been running for three years I don't think they've actually had any graduates from my.
PS0BK|No.
PS0BS|course yet either.
PS0BK|Why.
PS0BS|Cos it's only been running for three years.
PS0BK|Oh of course it's a four year course.
PS0BS|four year course.
PS0BK|So they don't really know how it runs do they.
PS0BS|No They don't know how it's gon na work I mean it I mean er the reason why it was set up really was the nineteen ninety two sort of like coming into the single European market and everything.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BS|that's what gave them the sort of the idea to set it up but I mean Aston is good because now we're n now we're not.
