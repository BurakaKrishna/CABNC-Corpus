PS0BS|Where was it stolen from.
PS0BK|But that's so pointless cos it's got all the addresses your addresses in it.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|It's such a tossy you sure it wasn't in the bag.
PS0BL|Yeah I'm absolutely positive I remember leaving it on the seat It was stolen from my car my car was broken into.
PS0BK|How long did you actually leave the er how long were you away from the car for.
PS0BL|Erm well it happened some time between about two and six.
PS0BK|It was a bit silly to leave your bag on the front seat though.
PS0BL|Yeah but we were sitting in a er we were in a cul-de-sac in a nice area.
PS0BK|Yeah you don't think do you You don't think at all Mind you my mum was telling me on Christmas day right Christmas day Erm you know that Georgian house on my road on th my side of the road up the road Looks way out of place Well not as way out of place as a British Telecom building would look but it looks quite erm looks quite out of place but erm this massive great obnoxious Georgian building erm was broken into on Christmas morning right They picked the lock on the house the front fucking door All the people were in bed in the house woke up in the morning the front door was wide open the video and T V had gone and the stereo And so they pi they we came into the house when everyone was asleep That would freak me out so much you just wouldn't feel safe in your house ever again would you Cos equally a rapist could pick the lock and come in and and do you know what I mean Er you'd just feel I couldn't believe that thought fucking hell So my dad's having all the locks changed Stepped up the security in our house Outrageous.
PS0BS|stepdad.
PS0BK|No stepped up the security in the house.
PS0BS|Oh.
PS0BK|Hey Nance Nance Nance Nance you know you were telling me that you thought someone had died at work I I sort of heard Debbie and Chris talking the other day and I might have got it totally mixed up but I reckon I heard Chris saying that well basically what I gathered was that Andy might have a different father to Chris and it was Andy's father that's died right Cos Chris was saying things like oh his yeah he's been to the funeral and erm he's all of a sudden found that he's got loads of cousins he didn't even know about.
PS0BL|What so he did he didn't.
PS0BK|But I wonder if I wonder if Chris and Andy cos Chris and Andy's half brother is Steven who's Debbie's husband I'm wondering if they knew that they had different fathers Cos they don't call each other they're half brothers.
PS0BS|Maybe yeah Well Andy's look how Andy's got ginger hair.
PS0BK|Mm Chris is dark and sort of like totally doesn't look anything like Andy Not even one similarity Totally like.
PS0BL|And what they're supposed to be half brothers are they.
PS0BK|No they're supposed to be brothers.
PS0BS|But I reckon they've probably lived like brothers from a young age Cos look how much.
PS0BK|Yeah oh yeah.
PS0BS|older Chris is than Andy as well Well he isn't that much but he's a good nine years Nine ten eleven years older than Andy.
PS0BK|So maybe they did know.
PS0BS|Yeah I reckon they did.
PS0BK|And just sort of like did just called people.
PS0BS|Or Andy may er Andy Andy may be adopted or something like that.
PS0BK|Yeah maybe But it's just strange that Steven's called their half brother and they're called brothers Do you know what I mean.
PS0BS|Well maybe yeah but maybe Steven is er is a half brother through a third marriage erm at a later stage to when they his mum er they're er Chris' mum may have remarried who Andy calls mum erm remarried when Andy was you know fifteen and Chris was twenty five and then they and Steve was o old as well Steve was quite however o however how old Steve is he.
PS0BK|So then he'd be a stepbrother.
PS0BS|Oh mixed up.
PS0BK|Maybe we don't know Maybe we're just gossiping.
PS0BS|Maybe we're just damn fucking nosy.
PS0BK|It was funny cos I could hear them talking and I was really sort of like.
PS0BS|So obviously then I reckon it must be his dad and that's obviously why Andy saying oh look your dad's died.
PS0BK|Yeah.
PS0BS|Cos Chris doesn't seem that bothered really does he Maybe he wouldn't know him.
PS0BK|Mm Maybe Andy didn't know him And he just went because it was his father's funeral But then why would he have to go to the morgue for an identification he wouldn't know what he looked like Maybe he's next of kin.
PS0BS|Stop it.
PS0BK|Aren't we nosy though Aren't I nosy I mean.
PS0BS|I better go.
