PS0BL|I suppose if you think about it his parents probably think it's probably good to get him out of London and get him doing something.
PS0BK|Yes because at the moment he's just I mean he's I mean he hasn't I mean he had that job in Debenhams and that's it isn't it really.

PS0BK|I don't want anything to do with it really at the moment.
PS0BL|like a bit not pointless well it it's just that I don't really I'm not getting anything from it at the moment so.
PS0BK|Yeah same here But I mean that's just the way it goes you know and it's good to have you've got to have breaks You can't just.

PS0BL|Think it'll end up a bop.
PS0BK|Yeah And also my friend is gon na come I invited her last oh it was the last time I spoke to her.
PS0BL|Good.
PS0BK|And that'll be good for her as well cos it'll mean that she'll meet and Craig.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|and maybe she'll have someone to visit in London cos she hasn't really got any friends in London.
PS0BL|Whereabouts does she live in London.
PS0BK|Tt I think she lives in Clapham or something the rain cries a little pity of one more forgotten hero.
PS0BL|Was Nancy gon na come down do you think Or is she gon na stay here.
PS0BK|I don't know I haven't asked her if she wants to come yet really I don't think Oh no her sister and all her mates are coming up this weekend and say for you It'd be quite good it'd be quite good to be here actually but just to meet them but tt nah show you something.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|Mm Simon's just brilliant isn't he really He just he can talk to anybody.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|Like this girl Tracey that he got on with really well I mean I I'd really disliked her this girl that Claire knows And when I arrived at this party she is totally unsubtle and sometimes very rude you know and er.
PS0BL|Yeah well the thing about Simon that's excellent is that he just accepts people for what they are and he doesn't judge people.
PS0BK|Yeah Yeah.
PS0BL|which means if you don't judge people then you know it's just so much easier.
PS0BK|Mm Yeah.
PS0BL|I wonder how he's gon na find it not being with her.
PS0BK|He's gon na find it hard as well I think but on the other hand they haven't been communicating at all you know it's not like.
PS0BL|No it's not as if it happened suddenly.
PS0BK|Mm Yeah I think Helen's gon na find it very difficult though Just because even though they don't talk very much any more and stuff and he probably hasn't been spending much time with her.
PS0BL|That he's been.
PS0BK|the thought that he's been there and it's yeah.
PS0BL|Well I mean they're engaged for God's sake you know She thought they were gon na get married.
PS0BK|Yeah In the jingle jangle Yeah Is Andy gone out.
PS0BL|He's gone up to smoke I think.
PS0BK|Oh has he Shall we sit in my room.
PS0BK|Music And that way you don't have to just sort of.
PS0BL|Do you know whose button this is.
PS0BK|No.
PS0BL|Yeah I think I think Dave was I think Dave felt a bit nostalgic coming back actually.
PS0BK|Do you.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|What a bit sad.
PS0BL|Well he he did when he came in here he picked up his and he looked round and it was all very different and then.
PS0BK|What in here In this room.
PS0BL|Yeah Yeah I think maybe he's just come to realize that.
PS0BK|Yeah I'll come following you He d yeah it was odd when Frank said that cos apparently what happened he just sort of started saying that he didn't think that Frank had really been there for him and that he was being a bit sort of selfish and stuff which I mean maybe he has been but the thing is if you know if Frank's making this massive effort to like fit in and meet new people and stuff then.
PS0BL|Yeah.
PS0BK|you know Dave's bound to feel a bit neglected It's a bit stupid to have all this in front of a bloody radiator in n it Whoops We've got ta get a we've got ta that thing.
PS0BK|play a song for me.
