PS0T5|I can remember when you'd see a cloud of dust perhaps it'll be a mile away and this would be a flock of sheep Course they hadn't had lorries in them days they drive them on the road and you see old shepherd coming along with a couple of dogs and goodness knows how many sheep And of course the roads were all gravel then no tarmac see this cloud of dust across there And er if you see it was coming towards of course you run into them but if they were going the other way course the dust still keep going But but of course this was many years ago Never see a flock of sheep on the road now It's all done with cars.
PS0SW|You wouldn't like this dairy you wouldn't.
