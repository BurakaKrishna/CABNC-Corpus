PS1EA|Yes this beef's come out very well hasn't it It's very tender.
PS1E8|Mm.
PS1E9|Yes very nice.
PS1E8|Delicious.
PS1EA|It's not maybe as rare as you ought to have it but it really tastes nice With disasters and all it's come out reasonably well at the end of the day.
PS1E9|Did it have a disaster.
PS1E6|Yes dad.
PS1E7|Oh It's lovely Well you've created something rather nice out of your disaster then.
PS1E9|The cornflour packet didn't have much left in it.
PS1E6|The gravy's a disaster It's got too much fat in it.
PS1E4|I didn't think it had got enough.
PS1E7|Well I never put salt and pepper in my gravy so.
PS1E8|If you use cornflour.
PS1E7|I use cornflour and two Oxo's.
PS1E8|Do you.
PS1E7|Yeah That's what I normally use.
PS1E8|Yeah.
PS1E7|If I'm then doing things if I'm doing beef gravy I put the beef stock cube and either one or two Oxo's to.
PS1E8|Oh.
PS1E7|of cornflour And then add all the juices from the meat But I don't add anything else.
PS1EA|gravy we're having today.
PS1E7|No.
PS1EA|This is totally different.
PS1E7|I never put salt and pepper in my gravy I never have done.
PS1E9|No That's what I like like about mum's gravy.
PS1E7|But I always add all the juices from the meat Out of the meat tin and.
PS1E9|How did you do this gravy then dad.
PS1E6|With difficulty No you've got Bovril you've got erm Oxo's some garlic and pepper and some cornflour and then your mother had to lob in some something else Because we'd run out of cornflour and it was all not thick enough.
PS1E9|lob in.
PS1E9|Your use of the English language in front of the microphone is extremely.
PS1E4|What are you talking about.
PS1E6|It's lucky I don't talk to a microphone very often.
PS1E9|a microphone over there dad and it's turned on.
PS1E6|Oh no.
PS1E4|Nobody'll know who's speaking.
PS1E9|No well But they will now.
PS1E4|So I don't think it matters.
PS1E9|They'll.
PS1E4|they don't know who your dad is.
PS1E9|They do.
PS1E4|They don't.
PS1E9|They know whose household this is.
PS1E4|They don't.

PS1E8|Very nice Yorkshires John.
PS1E6|Did you do them.
PS1EA|Well Alex mixed the mix I put them in the oven and Sue told me get them out or they'll burn So it was a sort of a three way erm.
PS1E6|Oh I see yeah.
PS1EA|thing really.
PS1E7|They were only burning because you put in what was written on the packet.
PS1EA|Well what's written on the packet is correct unless you have the grill not exactly red hot but about three eighty five Twenty five minutes isn't a bad time.
PS1E7|Oh I never cook them for twenty twenty to twenty five minutes it would be a disaster.
PS1EA|Oh well.
PS1E6|Nor've I.
PS1E8|I was going to say do you cook Alexander.

PS1E6|I did most of the preparation Mum looked after what was cooking.
PS1E7|It's the preparation that takes so long in Chinese cooking.
PS1E8|Mm.
PS1E9|Well there's so many different bits to it isn't there That's the trouble.
PS1E7|When I do a Chinese meal.
PS1E6|It's just having everything there.
PS1E7|Yeah.
PS1E6|There's so many bits of sauce and.
PS1E7|I spent about two hours measuring out all the different things Then I put labels on about every single pot I could find that's got all these various mixes in And I've got sort of like sweet and sour with prawns sort of er raising mix for something else Oh gosh.
PS1E6|That's what I don't like with Chinese erm everything's so complicated So what you do is.
PS1E7|It's part of the cooking.
PS1E6|yeah You just shove everything in a pan.
PS1E8|Do you go out to restaurants for a Chinese meal.
PS1E6|That's what you know when I did that er Chinese bolognese thing.
PS1E7|what.
PS1E8|at all.
PS1EA|We used to.
PS1E6|Do you remember when I did that Chinese bolognese thing I made half of that up.
PS1E7|Mm.
PS1E6|But I got the main thing off a off a tv programme But I couldn't get I didn't get it all down.
PS1E7|So you made up the rest.
PS1E6|So I made up the rest and everyone liked it.
PS1EA|You actually need a bigger kitchen to cook Chinese.
PS1E6|Yeah Because you need to set everything out Like I did when I did it I just.
PS1E6|put it back well I put it back got that put a bit of that in Put a bit of everything in apart from the vegetables which I knew what to put in.
PS1E8|I don't think you'd like me doing that Alex You complain as it is about the number of dishes I use.
PS1E9|Mm.
PS1E8|I could imagine if I did Chinese.
PS1E6|I don't use that many dishes when I do Chinese I don't I just put little drops.
PS1EA|We have the same argument in this household.
PS1E4|Mhm.
PS1E8|You have the what.
PS1EA|Same argument in this household.
PS1E6|Well I can use one bowl but I don't I use two.
PS1EA|Never use five bowls if one will do.
PS1E6|When it's like pancake mix I tend or omelettes I tend to use two bowls and even though I only really need to use one.
PS1E8|Well that's silly Why do you do that.
PS1E9|Where is then.
