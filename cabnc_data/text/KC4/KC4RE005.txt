PS1EA|you can't stand any too much she's always on the move.
PS1E6|She's nice She comes to all the all the football.
PS1EA|Yes she is she's very nice but you don't actually want to if you're on the the touchline you don't want to stand next to her.
PS1E6|Why.
PS1EA|Well she's jumping up and down she's screaming and laughing and shouting at people and hollering oh.
PS1E4|That that's what she goes there for.
PS1E6|I think the worst thing is when their team at matches They were losing and she knew they were going to lose and their last bloke was coming in and she was cheering them on She was cheering them on.
PS1E4|Ah we we her and I cheered on who who who couldn't score he never they never got a score.
PS1E6|Oh was that Trinity.
PS1E4|No it wasn't Trinity no It was yeah they'd come quite a long way actually.
PS1E6|Oh yeah hang on I can't think who they are but they came all the way And we're all going out on the field going come on very good we're gon na beat your team and we got our man and we scored about seven tries in the first three minutes.
PS1E4|Oh not hardly not quite.
PS1E8|It's a very rough game Alexander.
PS1E9|Oh Alex's got some.
PS1E4|twenty seconds.
PS1E9|telling you the rules Tell daddy what they're changing.
PS1E6|Oh they're going to change the rules that erm you know there's two scrumhalfs start on their side of the scrum well they can't come round to the other side Cos you know you've got.
PS1EA|Yeah.
PS1E6|in the centre of the scrum you've half and you've got.
PS1EA|So as long as you're behind the ball you can keep moving.
PS1E6|No.
PS1EA|Well you that's what you can do at the moment.
PS1E6|Yeah but the new rules for our age group is you have half of the scrum and then you have the scrumhalf and he puts the ball in and he goes back to his side doesn't he And the other scrumhalf and normally the other scrumhalf will come round and tackle him Or push him off the ball or something.
PS1EA|Yes As long as he stays stays behind the ball then he's allowed to do that.
PS1E6|Well they're not allowed to they're not allowed to yeah but they're not allowed to do that any more.
PS1EA|He can't so he can't come.
PS1E6|No And he can't you can't do twist any more.
PS1E4|Can't you.
PS1E6|No The number eight can't pick it up.
PS1E4|Oh.
PS1E6|And erm I can't remember what the other one is.
PS1E6|Oh you can't push more than one point four metres or something or other.
PS1E7|Oh my god Do you take a tape measure with you.
PS1E6|No but so if you.
PS1EA|five minute scrum you can't push over.
PS1E6|You can't push.
PS1EA|That's silly isn't it.
PS1E6|yeah The reason is you've got to take.
PS1E7|take out all the extra sort of strain.
PS1E6|All of the extra strain on the.
PS1EA|I suppose the trouble is yeah if you do push if you do go for that the other side cos you just sort of push them into the.
PS1E4|What about when you.
PS1E6|Yeah.
PS1EA|in a big mangled heap.
PS1E4|what about when you what about when you make.
PS1E6|the first row Oh as soon as as soon as you about over fifteens er is normal rules This is all under fifteen The good thing about being in the scrum is when you push over and they all collapse and you fall on top of them Or you stand there and you walk over them.
PS1E8|Do they get as much pleasure about walking over you.
PS1E6|No cos I normally hit back.
PS1E9|What was this.
PS1E6|Tighthead prop.
PS1E9|Who.
PS1E6|Tighthead prop.
PS1E8|I think that's tighthead prop.
PS1E9|Prop forward.
PS1E6|That's what it's called.
PS1E7|I don't know much about rugby.
PS1E6|Better than golf.
PS1E9|four five days really.
PS1E6|It's better than golf.
PS1E8|Don't you like golf.
PS1E6|No boring.
PS1E7|Golf.
PS1E6|Yeah golf.

PS1E6|Yes Lots.
PS1E4|What golf.
PS1E6|Not I'm not very good at it Boring.
PS1E8|Oh I see as you're no good at it it's boring.
PS1E6|No cos it's you just watch somebody smack a ball as hard as they can with the one wood and see how far it goes.
PS1E8|But you've got an objective you've got to get it down a hole.
PS1E6|Yeah put it in a hole.
PS1E8|Well yes I know but.
PS1E6|That's easy.
PS1E8|look at the money they make golfers.
PS1E6|Yeah look at the money skateboarders make Do you know how much do you know how much the world champion earns in one year.
PS1E8|No.
PS1E6|He will earn something like seven million dollars.
PS1E8|What for skateboarding.
PS1E6|Yes he does You ought to see his house.
PS1E4|This is America is it.
PS1E6|He's got wooden hall wooden lounge.
PS1E7|Doesn't allow any pedestrians.
PS1E6|No pedestrians no cars Erm he's got three videos.
PS1E7|He skateboards all the way from the house.
PS1E6|he's got portable video tv little thing like er like the Sony ones on Virgin He's got three tv's computer video cameras everything.
PS1E7|He's got his own skateboard ramp in his back garden and he video tapes what he does so that he can watch what he's doing wrong and all the rest of it.
PS1E6|And he's got these twenty nine twenty eight.
PS1E8|How ridiculous On a skateboard.
PS1E6|Why's it ridiculous.
PS1E8|What's so wonderful about skateboarding.
PS1E7|Well because he's very skilled No I accept now that it's it's extremely skilful.
PS1E6|It's very skilful.
PS1E7|It's just as skilful as most other sports Just as skilful as skiing and and er ice skating though it's not phenomenal about sports.
PS1E6|It's just you're just thinking that if there's anybody who skateboards just skates and like really ragged clothes because you're not exactly gon na go out wearing a suit skateboarding cos as soon as you fall off you you're gon na rip it to shreds aren't you.
PS1E8|True I can not see skateboarding being sports.
PS1E6|It's in the next Olympics.
PS1E4|Oh yeah they do it on these er they must be you know.
PS1E6|It's gon na be in the next Olympics For speed skating slalom and round And street style Are all gon na be in the next Olympics.
PS1E4|As much a sport as you could call erm.
PS1E8|Well I dare say but it's far more dignified to play golf.
PS1E4|Oh what do you you know erm that sort of thing.
PS1E6|Why's it far more dignified They're just stuck up normally.
PS1E8|No they're not.
PS1E6|Load of stuck up.
PS1E8|To play golf erm it's really quite.
PS1E6|Have I got to play golf.
PS1E4|Well golf is is hardly a sport it's not in the it's not like it's in the Olympics is it.
PS1E9|No.
PS1E4|No it's a sport but I mean it's erm Well to most people it's a pastime isn't it.
PS1E6|Yeah.
PS1E4|Pastime for ordinary golfers.
PS1E7|What there's Nick Faldo makes a lot of money at it anyway.
PS1E4|Oh well it's a sport for him yes But I say for most ordinary people who play it it's a pastime.
PS1E8|It's not easy hitting that little ball you know.
PS1E6|Yes it is.
PS1E8|It is not.
PS1E6|It is.
PS1E8|It is not.
PS1E6|It is.
PS1E8|It is not.
PS1E6|It is it is I can even slice it and I've only played golf once.
PS1E4|Oh I don't know If you've got if you've got.
PS1E4|a good eye there's nothing hard in hitting the ball It's if it goes where you want it to that's hard.
PS1E8|Precisely Precisely.
PS1E4|Well that applies to any any sport any kind of sport.
PS1E6|Apart from cricket where you just smack it as hard as you can.
PS1E7|I I I think there's an art to that as well.
PS1E6|Yeah there is I can play it sort of.
PS1E4|I du n no cricket cricket.
PS1E6|I can bowl I'm quite a bowler.
PS1E4|cricket is.
PS1E6|I'm extremely fast armed Not very accurate Well I I can't I don't bowl them out I have to bowl them about that far away from the wickets So I get if I get them on target I normally get a couple of wickets.
PS1E8|Mm.
PS1E6|Cos I'm really fast Or I get an L B.
PS1E7|Well he is at javelin and what was the other thing he was throwing the discus.
PS1E4|Discus.
PS1E6|No It's shot.
PS1E4|No no no the shot.
PS1E6|I don't like shot.
PS1E7|Oh the shot Are you still doing that.
PS1E6|No.
PS1E4|Putting the shot.
PS1E7|You were good.
PS1E6|No.
PS1E7|Didn't you come second in that.
PS1E6|Yeah but I was just got out of it not very good at it.
PS1E7|Now I can't see any sense in throwing whatsit the javelin Now honestly.
PS1E9|We were just saying you ought to be good at that.
PS1E6|Well I am.
PS1E6|spear broke you throw it at the ground.
PS1E4|You don't you throw it at animals to kill them.
PS1E6|Yeah but basically downwards all the time Why can't you see the point in throwing a javelin.
PS1E7|No I can't see much sport in that.
PS1E9|I can't see you do it this year.
PS1E6|Why not.
PS1E4|Well I think it's a lot there's a lot of.
PS1E7|What is it that you know it doesn't achieve anything does it.
PS1E4|Well of course it does It it achieves just as much as softly doing hop skip and a jump What's the difference.
PS1E6|It it achieves the same as somebody somebody putting a ball in a hole with with as least hits as he can.
PS1E4|It achieves it achieves as much as some as somebody throwing a hammer Or a shot.
PS1E8|Oh yeah.
PS1E4|Or jumping jumping over an eight foot fence.
PS1E8|Yes.
PS1E7|Well they're not erm are they.
PS1E4|Can't tell the difference.
PS1E8|I know they're all the same You wrap all those all that lot up in one sort of you know.
PS1E4|Well I think it's very interesting It it it it takes a lot of doing.
PS1E6|Yeah it does It's got a lot of skill in it actually.
PS1E4|There's a lot of skill in it There's a lot of skill in javelin throwing.
PS1E6|It is There's more skill in that than there is the discus.
PS1E4|There is.
PS1E6|Discus.
PS1E4|Might just as well.
PS1EA|make a good as well.
PS1E6|Yes.
PS1E4|There's a lot of skill in discus sonny don't you forget it.
PS1E6|Oh yeah there is actually Oh shot put's probably the easiest to do.
PS1E4|Shot put is more is more.
PS1E6|Brute force.
PS1E4|Brute force.
PS1E6|Whereas javelin is a lot of skill.
PS1E4|I mean the hammer the hammer is.
PS1E7|Surely javelin is brute force as well.
PS1E6|Yeah but it's got to spill and spin right.
PS1E7|It isn't brute isn't javelin the same it's brute force.
PS1E6|No Because however however much brute force you put in it's how you put through the javelin.
PS1E4|It's how you put it through.
PS1E6|If you it as far as far as you can you've got to when you throw javelin you've got to bring your arm through right you've got to twist you've got to make sure your wrist's tight you've got to keep your erm left foot planted.
PS1E6|You've got to oh you've just to keep it straight It's very hard.
PS1E4|Very very.
PS1E7|Alright then alright then.
PS1E4|You see you don't just you don't just go like this.
PS1E8|technique in in playing golf.
PS1E6|Yeah there is a technique.
PS1E8|That's alright then.
PS1E6|Golf technique extremely easy.
PS1E4|Yes but surely Alexander you're you're only saying that er you don't er the more you golf.
PS1E6|Yeah I know but I know that's all I said.
PS1E4|I mean the you don't get many You do get youngsters as young as you they do they do by by the time.
PS1E6|Yeah but it's no.
PS1E8|Well they start it it's the same way that er very young people er start playing snooker don't they.
PS1E6|Well I play snooker.
PS1E8|Time they get to about sixteen or seventeen you know they can be up in the top players You certainly make money if you begin.
PS1E9|Young people play bowls these days too.
PS1E8|They don't make much money at it though.
PS1E9|No no Bowls is a sport that they don't make much money.
PS1EA|money I think it's the sport that counts.
PS1E8|I know but I mean.
PS1E6|Yeah it's not whether you win or lose it's how you play the game.
PS1E8|Oh dear.
PS1EA|They make a few quid don't they at bowls.
PS1E6|Well they do cheat or not.
PS1E8|No.
PS1EA|guys at the top what is it Tony Al Tony Alcock.
PS1E9|Tony Alcock But they don't win.
PS1E8|Oh you cruel thing.
PS1E6|Cruel It's a very rough sport.
PS1E9|What is.
PS1E8|I know it is.
PS1E6|Rugby.
PS1E8|I don't know why you play it.
PS1E6|Cos I like hitting people I like hitting my balls ugh.
PS1E8|streak in you.
PS1E8|Yeah well I take after my mum.
PS1E8|Do you Do you have er young boys at your school Do they have to do all your bidding and fetching and carrying and things.
PS1E6|No They used to but they don't any more they've taken all that sort of brilliant stuff away But they did that to me when I was their age and now as soon as I get to fourteen when when you can when you can when you could do that And now today it's not fair.
PS1E8|Mm.
PS1E8|No it's probably right that you don't bully the youngsters.
PS1E6|Well they did it to me.
PS1E8|Yes but you didn't like it did you.
PS1E6|N n But they did it to everybody it happened to everybody.
PS1E9|Except when you get there and they stop it.
PS1E6|Yeah we're not even allowed to report them any more Put them on the landing No because it's just oh no you'll get them all cold.
PS1E8|Where you ever put on the landing.
PS1E6|Mhm.
PS1E7|Often.
PS1E4|What for.
PS1E6|Hitting people normally.
PS1EA|Hitting people.
PS1E6|Yeah with my pillows We had pillow fights Bed slipper fights.
PS1E4|Well you weren't the only one out on the landing then.
PS1E6|No everybody was.
PS1E4|There was probably more of you on the landing than there was.
PS1E6|There wasn't But one night we tried to get the whole entire floor out on the landing Well some of us swapped and the Gammas didn't want to do it All the Alpha Betas and most of the Gammas were out on the landing and they ran out of room And so they started putting people downstairs everywhere and shoving them in corners that nobody even.
PS1E8|Are you sorry that your Mr's leaving.
PS1E6|No Well I am a little bit.
PS1E8|Oh Was he nice to you all you boys.
PS1E6|Well he well you know but just because he's leaving he he seems to think that he's got to upturn the upturn the upturn the term And everything has gone to pot.
PS1E7|I'm very surprised at that.
PS1E6|Everything thing's gone all weird and nobody knows what's happening They've changed all the things that used to be just because they know Like form twos always used to have an end of term leaving party But now they're not just so all the people can have one because Mr and Mrs are leaving.
PS1E7|Oh well.
PS1E6|It was the form twos the only thing that I that they had to they had to look forward to in the whole time they were there And I've been there since Alpha and I every year I've looked out and watched the form twos And now suddenly just as soon as I come to form twos they've taken that away.
PS1E8|What you're in form two now.
PS1E6|Yeah They've taken all the privileges away.
PS1E8|Ah Is it only a temporary.
PS1E6|No We don't know We don't have any teachers for about eighteen months He does look like one Have you seen him.
PS1E7|No.
PS1E4|Has he got a long brown habit on.
PS1E6|No but he's got hair like one He looks.
PS1E8|Yeah but you won't be in you Alexander will it.
PS1E6|I know it's good No.
PS1E8|After after er you break up in the summer.
PS1E6|Yeah I know that's good.
PS1E8|So next year form two can have their party Ask if you can join them.
PS1E6|No Wouldn't want to mix with that bunch anyway.
PS1E8|But you are one of them now.
PS1E6|What one of the form ones.
PS1E8|Yeah I thought you were a form two.
PS1E6|Yeah but.
PS1E7|Well what are the form ones like.
PS1E8|Oh I see form ones will be form two next year Right.
PS1E6|load of rabble.
PS1E9|Well they're the same as you were last year aren't they.
PS1E6|Well yeah I know But that's how the form twos thought of us last year as well load of rabble.
PS1E9|Yes.
PS1E7|That one year can make such a difference can't it.
PS1E9|school he'll be.
PS1E8|Oh you're gon na be the rabble again aren't you.
PS1E6|I know cool I like being the rabble cos you never have any responsibilities If you're form two they always look to you to I mean we can't do our thing by ourselves but soon as something needs done doing they look to us.
PS1E9|Well there you are you're the responsible lot aren't you.
PS1E6|I know but we can't do we can't do anything apart from be told what to do by the teachers We can't tell people what to do.
PS1E8|Well that's right You shouldn't have to.
PS1E6|We're not allowed to wreak punishment apart from when our floor.
PS1E8|That I believe is right too why should you.
PS1E6|Why because we were at in Alpha and Beta and Gamma and form one we were always admitted punishment by form twos Whatever they felt like they sort of.
PS1E7|They've never had people like barks or tells.
PS1E6|No they're called.
PS1EA|alright isn't he.
PS1E6|Yeah I know but he admitted a lot of punishments.
PS1EA|Did he.
PS1E6|Yes.
PS1E7|I don't think your mum would like you sticking that.
PS1E4|I was gon na say if you keep doing that you'll be getting some.
PS1E8|Would you like to say.
PS1E6|Yes.
PS1E6|Present from mummy.
PS1EA|dishwasher.
PS1E7|Oh shall we go and sit in the other room while daddy finishes the washing up.
PS1E8|Oh it's not fair that he did some.
PS1EA|did all the serious bits.
PS1E7|You made the gravy.
PS1EA|Well the rest.
