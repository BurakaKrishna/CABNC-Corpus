PS0BY|Oh yeah.
KC8PSUN|so if you wanted to go see if you change William's thing to the colour I want and if they had he said he thought the shirt that the guy got with it matched it better than the smaller check so do you wan na give him that check shirt that I bought him.
PS0BY|Yes how much is that.
KC8PSUN|Nine ninety nine.
PS0BY|Mm.
KC8PSUN|It was just a thought that I.
PS0BY|mm alright.
KC8PSUN|can take it back.
KC8PSUN|that it was a nice one it was a brushed one.
PS0BY|No that'll be al I I just haven't got a clue what to what to get him I I mean I'm still stuck for father women I I seem to be getting on quite well for the women it's just finding some.
KC8PSUN|What col what col.
PS0BY|come on granddad move your bottom.
KC8PSUN|what colour did you say.
PS0BY|what colour.
KC8PSUN|cords.
PS0BY|Black why.
KC8PSUN|Well I don't know.

KC8PSUN|So is he alright for sweaters.
PS0BY|Erm.
KC8PSUN|You know I've got to work it out.
KC8PSUN|Mum.
KC8PSUN|what I've.
KC8PSUN|what William's will come to and.
PS0BY|Well he's alright he's got a navy sweater and a grey multi sweater.
KC8PSUN|He'd would he be into one of these.
PS0BY|One of these what Waistcoats.
KC8PSUN|Yes for his cars.
PS0BY|Well actually I've I've I'm toying with the idea I haven't quite made my mind up erm I've seen some wax waistcoats.
KC8PSUN|Oh.
PS0BY|wax jackets but they're a waistcoat and I've I've ordered one really just to see what it's it's like because erm at the moment I can I just try and get a bit closer to the door I think we'll go round again erm cos in the in my club book at the moment I I can get twenty percent off and which brings it down to it's twe well say thirty pound so twenty per cent off it brings me down to erm brings it down to twenty four pounds and then erm with my commission off that brings it down to just under twenty one pound.
KC8PSUN|mm.
PS0BY|so I'm toying that's what I'm toying with at the moment is this erm wax jacket.
KC8PSUN|Oh.
PS0BY|well it's not a jacket it's a sort as I say it's a waistcoat Oh there's one right in front of us look blind as a bloody bat Gill.
KC8PSUN|Dad's just got in.
PS0BY|Oh gawld move forward a bit so that's what I was going to get but erm in Bewise they've got erm checked shirts and they're five ninety nine this brushed cotton thing so I thought if I get him that waistcoat and a pair of cords erm and get him one of these brushed cotton shirts that'll be that sort of colour.
KC8PSUN|How much are the cords then.
PS0BY|What in the club book.
KC8PSUN|No.
PS0BY|Cords in general.
KC8PSUN|eh.
PS0BY|Erm.
KC8PSUN|Mummy.
PS0BY|yes we're now going sweetheart erm.
KC8PSUN|mummy.
PS0BY|I think they're about fifteen something like that fifteen sixteen really depends whether you buy needlecord or erm this thickish cord.
KC8PSUN|Well what do you want.
PS0BY|Well I'm I'm easy I mean the thickish cord erm washes ni they wear better I think the thickish cord but I mean erm and they're a bit warmer but if you shop about usually you can get them erm the same price as the needlecord I'll leave that with you right.
KC8PSUN|If we've got to go to Boston at some point for the bras you see so erm.
PS0BY|Mm oh oh I'll leave that with you anyway.
KC8PSUN|I'm a bit concerned you know about this just this one week's wages you know because I would have thought once Jack got his time sheet out he would perhaps realised that.
PS0BY|Just ring Derek up.
KC8PSUN|no but on the other hand I've got a certificate till then so if the if the money has run out for what he pays me.
PS0BY|mm.
KC8PSUN|and he claims back I'm still entitled to er.
PS0BY|oh yeah.
KC8PSUN|sick pay from somewhere aren't I.
PS0BY|yeah you're allowed.
KC8PSUN|and I.
PS0BY|you're allowed twenty six er twenty six weeks off.
KC8PSUN|I thought I was.
PS0BY|I'm sure it's twenty six weeks off on full pay and then you go on.
KC8PSUN|Mm.
PS0BY|whatever whatever.
KC8PSUN|yeah.
PS0BY|they call it this week it changes names every week.
KC8PSUN|yeah.
PS0BY|so you.
KC8PSUN|it says.
PS0BY|I wouldn't know that.
KC8PSUN|statutory sick pay.
PS0BY|yeah but I'm sure the the first one's for twenty six weeks.
KC8PSUN|Yeah but I'm su you know I did debate whether it was twenty.
PS0BY|No no I'm sure it was twenty six.
KC8PSUN|I thought it was six twenty six.
KC8PSUN|if Derek and he went away last weekend he perhaps stuffed it in here but then he drops it in when he finds it.
PS0BY|mm.
KC8PSUN|but Jack is so temperamental these days I mean the other day he went by he said oh.
KC8PSUN|I nearly forgot you I mean one week he rang me and had it pinched out of his car.
PS0BY|Yeah.
KC8PSUN|and then he found it stuffed down the bottom so he don't know what he does with it.
PS0BY|Oh so he found that.
KC8PSUN|Yeah it was in his car.
PS0BY|He reckoned it was pinched outside the post office.
KC8PSUN|yeah he said oh Margaret wages have been took out me car he said I ge I'll get it at some point for you Margaret he said when I go at the bank but he said yours was taken out Jack's car.
PS0BY|What.
KC8PSUN|he said yeah and then.
PS0BY|then he found it.
KC8PSUN|and then er I whether Jack or Derek came up with it he said it was found in the car.
PS0BY|Well I think you ought to ring Well's.
KC8PSUN|Oh I will after this weekend you know because if.
PS0BY|yeah but.
KC8PSUN|if they just bring one I shall say well I've got choice then to say well is this this week's or last week's now I don't want to give them that opportunity to say well she's worrying about one week's wages I mean Jan could love that and that's given him chance to bring er whereas if it pops through the door or he comes.
PS0BY|mm.
KC8PSUN|I shall say to him what's happened is this this week's or last week's.
PS0BY|mm and if he says well I've already got last week's here.
KC8PSUN|Oh well then I'll say well that ain't.
PS0BY|Right come on then off we go.
