KC8PSUN|Hello hello hello.

PS0BY|She thinks she's going.
KC8PSUN|No Charlotte.
PS0BY|Oh erm let me slow down this bit erm no it's twen oh it is twenty six ninety nine anywhere else I've seen it but in Argos Wi well William looked in the catalogue on Tuesday for me but he said it was nineteen ninety nine in Argos.
KC8PSUN|Yeah.
PS0BY|but erm had a little with the children's Christmas presents.
KC8PSUN|Who.
PS0BY|Was it Monday no it was yesterday I was in the loo and I could hear this paper being ripped and I thought oh they've got one of my club catalogues I didn't think any more of it and then I could hear Joseph going weee I thought what the devil's he got so went out Joseph has got the flying circus bus that was meant for Charlotte and him and Brenda and Charlotte was sharing the the garage thing that I've brought so I thought well now it's out well they're not going to keep all that till I said to him whatever is Father Christmas going to say I said he's supposed to be taking these away to bring I said er what's Father Christmas gon na say no Ben forget so I thought while they're out I could see Joseph's playing a lot way with this bus thing he was having a whale of a time he thought that was great so I said to Charlotte I said do you like that bus Cos that was meant for her you see she said no I want the house she meant the garage so I said don't you like the bus then Charlotte no bus for Joseph bus for the baby so I thought well that's decided it then now I she she better have Mr Toot and.
KC8PSUN|Don't make a lot of difference really does it.
PS0BY|You see all.
KC8PSUN|when it's.
PS0BY|all the figures all erm sit er all the same.
KC8PSUN|yeah.
PS0BY|things you see so erm I thought right well that's it Ben can have the garage I'll go and buy her the flying circus Joseph can have the bus and call it a day.
KC8PSUN|Mm.
PS0BY|You know I mean they've still got a couple of books each and I've bought three.
KC8PSUN|Swing.
PS0BY|the swing and I've bought them a couple of wooden puzzles where you pick the bits up so I thought well then I'll call it a day there and that'll be that.
KC8PSUN|Well this is this is it Gilly cos I mean.
PS0BY|Oh you can keep going though totally over the top I thought well Joseph's was twelve ninety nine and Ben's was fourteen nineteen ninety nine and that's just tough that I've got you know I can't get Charlotte's any cheaper than that but I mean they're not gon na know how much I've they're not gon na say well you've got five pound more than what I have cos they're not of that age so that's how I've left it that's what I'm gon na do I'll get her the circus and then they can swap them over and Joseph will be happy that he got something on wheels.
KC8PSUN|Yeah.
PS0BY|I said to Robert.
KC8PSUN|He has got something on wheels from us.
PS0BY|yeah I said to Rob you can't keep buying them learning toys they've got ta.
KC8PSUN|Yeah.
PS0BY|play as well haven't they.
KC8PSUN|well that helps them as much really don't it.
PS0BY|Yeah so erm cos then I had the argument about putting them back in the box.
KC8PSUN|Tell you what I've got I keep getting I I shall think I'll have another one tonight is a great big egg box.
PS0BY|Mm well you see these these are big boxes on their own there putting them in another one.
KC8PSUN|Yes but I should you'd get one of those boxes in the end.
PS0BY|Do you think so.
KC8PSUN|Well those size of those boxes.
PS0BY|Yeah yeah.
KC8PSUN|I've I've got three of them now.
PS0BY|well I could do with I could actually do with one cos little bits and pieces but erm course then when I've them in.
KC8PSUN|I do rather use the one like me I'd like two cos I've got one full of bits and pieces and the odds odds and ends I keep.
PS0BY|Oh I've got the one that I've emptied this morning I think I found just the tiny.
KC8PSUN|Yeah.
PS0BY|So this.
KC8PSUN|I come up to that cow upstairs alright alright.
PS0BY|Mm.
KC8PSUN|you know er I think I've got to get me eyes tested cos this can make.
PS0BY|Well you said that months ago.
KC8PSUN|this well this can make you feel can't it.
PS0BY|Mm mm I mean its probably got to the st.
KC8PSUN|Sometimes I look.
PS0BY|its probably got to the stage where you want glasses all the time now just you know erm.
KC8PSUN|Yeah.
PS0BY|I mean that doesn't help as well I know Sainsbury's or Tesco's and you have to keep taking them off and putting them on.
KC8PSUN|Yes.
PS0BY|that doesn't help cos your eyes are not having time to adjust erm without the glasses before you put them back on again.
KC8PSUN|And I can't cope walking around in my reading glasses but I've got to.
PS0BY|Mm.
KC8PSUN|when I want to look at prices.
PS0BY|Pair of or something.
KC8PSUN|Oh my god.
PS0BY|No I meant the ones with the half moons in.
KC8PSUN|Yeah.
PS0BY|or where they change half way down so you haven't got to keep taking your glasses on and off.
KC8PSUN|Yeah they are got.
PS0BY|Are they I think with the half brim bits.
KC8PSUN|So erm Which I thought well where's that all about the cake other day that three pound one and then two of us went.
PS0BY|Oh god.
KC8PSUN|there must be a reason you know they they went well so I've got sixty of them they take them with me tonight and they said would there be any cakes available for Saturday and I I think and I nearly said to erm well last year you reckon you couldn't sell cakes but anyway I helped her.
KC8PSUN|Nan nan nan.
KC8PSUN|so and er I said do you sell butterfly ones and she said I was going to have a go at making them but she said I can't make them like you.
PS0BY|Aha.
KC8PSUN|I thought well I ain't.
PS0BY|It involves it involves too much work that's why she can't do them like you.
KC8PSUN|Christmas fillers you see so I she cos I've I'm going to make a couple of fruit cakes I said well I was going to bring in a couple of fruit cakes and said if you need them not if not I said I'll take them back I thought no way is Sue gon na eat them eat cakes like she did last year or year before.
PS0BY|Yeah.
KC8PSUN|she only had the bloody cheek to charge us last year for a turkey wrong but I mean I did get that sorted out afterwards.
PS0BY|So are you helping with the catering side or are you running a cake stall.
KC8PSUN|I can't run a cake stall Gilly cos when I got a book a someone erm wants to.
PS0BY|Oh yeah.
PS0BY|That's right oh.
KC8PSUN|say ya nay or and er so I.
PS0BY|Well as you said last year they really wanted something for nothing for it.
KC8PSUN|Yeah so what I'm doing I'll these gon na make about a hundred or one bit or a couple of bits and some butterfly cakes and the cakes and plates and cling film charge them a quid eight for a pound.
PS0BY|Mm.
KC8PSUN|and that that would be.
PS0BY|You're not telling me this Council driver can't go any quicker cos he'll try to get back to before before twelveo'clock.
KC8PSUN|I can't twelveo'clock dinner.
KC8PSUN|No we had a reasonably good dinner and and we didn't want no tea when we come home this could have been some of it cos all I had then when we did about seveno'clock when we decided we'd have a bowl of soup erm we stuffed ourselves we had toast and breakfast erm we had one or two sweets in the hospital er while we were waiting and then er we went to Asda and then we got er.
KC8PSUN|er pie chips and peas hot actually bread roll and butter for one ninety nine I wasn't half pleased well that just suit us cos it we would have gone somewhere else and had coffee and a cake it would of cost you one fifty each.
PS0BY|Oh yeah.
KC8PSUN|so erm we decided that we'd have this fish and chips before we got going cos it we didn't eat you know an awful lot yesterday.
KC8PSUN|so erm last night when we came home I looked at this Argos ticket which I couldn't find and I've in that I've found what erm a Weight Watcher er menu so I picked that out so I've had erm don't know what you'll call it today boiled egg and toast eh bread and butter.
