PS1BL|Where they get all their money from.
PS1BM|They're not getting it it's all on credit.
PS1BL|Oh that's bad news in n it.
PS1BM|Not if they can afford to pay it and they don't get too much it's interest free credit on fridge freezer.
PS1BL|Well I know it's still bad news cos they've got their mortgage and everything.
PS1BM|Well they're both working they've got a good good income every month now.
PS1BL|How much.
PS1BM|I du n no I think they should clear eleven hundred a month between them.
PS1BL|No in years.
PS1BM|I don't know how much they're getting.
PS1BL|clear eleven whatd' ya mean clear.
PS1BM|Well after you've had your tax and insurance taken off that's how much they should have between them.
PS1BL|What between them that.
PS1BM|at the end of the month.
PS1BL|that's only twelve thousand thirteen thousand a year that's crap that's what Gerrard gets just on his own.
PS1BM|Oh it must be more then I don't know then.
PS1BL|it's double that in n it Lesley gets more than Gerrard doesn't she.
PS1BM|She does now she's got this new job.
PS1BL|Oh it's about twice that.
PS1BM|what's Gerrard on ten thousand.
PS1BL|More than that twelve in n it.
PS1BM|Oh I don't think it's.
PS1BL|Twelve thirteen yeah cos he used to be on ten at the old place and he gets about two thousand more.
PS1BM|Oh was then ten Oh yeah well after you've taken tax and insurance back you see you've lost about three hundred three fifty.
PS1BL|Yeah under the Conservatives that if you'd been under Labour you would of lost about four hundred didn't think of that though did you didn't think your own son.
PS1BM|But they the Conservatives are cutting down on the health service and everything else and the schools.
PS1BL|So.
PS1BM|What are we going to do when there's no no health service They're going to get rid of it you know eventually.
PS1BL|No.
PS1BM|They are.
PS1BL|No they're they'll still be.
PS1BM|that's the way it's going.
PS1BL|they'll still be a health service but peo.
PS1BM|No.
PS1BL|but people who can afford to pay for it will be will be made to at the time.
PS1BM|Well that just.
PS1BL|which I think is right if you can afford to pay for it then you should be made made to.
PS1BM|But where do they draw the line at those who can afford to pay for it.
PS1BL|I don't know that's up to them.
PS1BM|No so I draw the pay a set amount each month and have peace of mind thank you very much.
PS1BL|Aargh.
PS1BM|even if I've never had to use it much.
PS1BL|Never even paid national insurance in your life have you mum.
PS1BM|Your dad pays his share for me comes out of his wages if I paid it's just extra on top of all that if I was paying any.
PS1BL|Well that oh it's no point in arguing.
PS1BM|Why You ask me so I told ya no point in arguing you won't make a very good politician shut up sod off.
PS1BL|Don't use that language.
PS1BM|I can't win this argument so shut up.
PS1BL|I shall bloody win.
PS1BM|Pardon.
PS1BL|I shall bloody win.
PS1BM|That's enough.
PS1BL|Why shouldn't why shouldn't we be made to pay for a health service.
PS1BM|Because it's it's a service for everyone as long as everybody gets the same.
PS1BL|The only good thing the only good thing about La the only good thing about Labour is that they would have brought back student grants so if I ever if I ever do go to university then I'll get lots of money.
PS1BM|And if Labour'd got in they'd of er your dad said he'd er probably got a rise.
PS1BL|Would he.
PS1BM|Mm I think he.
PS1BL|Rubbish how much.
PS1BM|Don't know Labour'd be more give more to the public sector don't they than the Conservatives.
PS1BL|Why he got a rise by the.
PS1BM|He might of done he said he probably would of done in the la the unions would of put in a big one for Mr Major wouldn't give one still wouldn't have affected.
