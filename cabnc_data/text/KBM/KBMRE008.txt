PS1BL|It's just you believe in baptizing.
PS1BP|Were you baptized.
PS1BN|No.
PS1BP|That makes sense.
PS1BL|Baptize you why not.
PS1BP|Why weren't you baptized.
PS1BN|You make such a decision you make when you when.
PS1BP|The decision you make when you.
PS1BN|Yeah.
PS1BP|Right aargh.
PS1BP|you don't christened at a baptist church.
PS1BN|Of course you can get baptized when ya er at any age can't ya.
PS1BP|It's not baptizing christening is different.
PS1BN|You can get baptized any time can't ya.
PS1BP|Yeah.
PS1BN|when you're baptized.
PS1BP|it's your own decision.
PS1BN|when you're baptized it's like a pool of water.
KBMPSUN|Three or four of us start er three or four of us talking yesterday day before yesterday erm about the attitude generally of erm students in the the sixth form years twelve and thirteen and.
KBMPSUN|and erm it struck us that erm possibly in this year's lower sixth erm there there are one or two people boys and er lads and girls erm who are not aware.
PS1BL|Boys and lads and girls.
KBMPSUN|of what sixth form courses entails now erm three or four of us thought it might be worth our while or your while if you just briefly said what I'm going to say now that erm the the.
PS1BL|It's a bit vague in n it.
KBMPSUN|work you do up to G C S E is very difficult that it should be very different from erm when you're in the sixth form.
PS1BL|Why.
KBMPSUN|Because until G C S E you are fed the school is fed in that you are told fairly quickly what you have to do and although I know that a number of you spends the right amount of time or a lot of time on homework you are told usually er you have erm a night or two nights in which to do this particular piece of work now once you get into the sixth form.
PS1BL|I can tell I'm not gon na like this.
KBMPSUN|you are given very much more freedom or independence would be a better word and erm.
PS1BL|Shit.
KBMPSUN|you'd be expected to to do a lot of work by yourself and that's reflecting the fact that erm you'll probably have four or five lessons in each of your three subjects but most people would choose three subjects for A level and that means that er when you're not having lessons you've got a lot of time that is not accountable for you will have been or going to a general studies period and stuff like that but there will be a fair number of private study periods erm there are some people I think who who go overboard and you've got such a different approach erm from er the lower sixth people don't use the time that they have erm what I'm really saying is that if you go into the sixth form and you spend less school time in the sixth form you don't need to be prepared.
PS1BL|Well what's.
KBMPSUN|to to make wise use of your non-teaching.
KBMPSUN|time erm presumably going into a library quite a lot You would also be expected to for example to prepare for.
PS1BL|Eh I'm not going into a library fuck that.
KBMPSUN|for certain lessons I just give you an example with literature it would work with erm science and er other things as well you might be told in the next lesson we are going to discuss for example the first act of a particular play or we're going to discuss which particular scientific experiment or the cause of whatever it is.
KBMPSUN|you will be expected to have done some research done some preparation before coming along to the lesson if you go along to the lesson not having done that you will be able to play back certain tips from what the other people say but you will not er you will find that.
KBMPSUN|anywhere near as if you were prepared because if you were prepared there are bound to be one or two things that you would want to ask for own by the standard of interpretation of whatever it is or a particular word if it's a language and so on erm and that is something that er I think people erm come across as.
PS1BL|Oh yeah sure.
KBMPSUN|and the other the other the other thing I don't want to make this sound a lecture or anything like that but the other thing is that erm erm you have.
PS1BL|You can stuff your lecture.
KBMPSUN|twenty one months in the sixth form please don't think that everybody has two years erm and those those.
PS1BL|Oh okay.
KBMPSUN|short two years may make a big difference at this stage now erm.
KBMPSUN|A levels only happen when the most a month more from school and then they have study leave as you are now erm when you consider the the year since September has gone very very quickly those who have done very little work in that first year year twelve will find that been packed in there and that first year in the sixth is just like your year ten ought to have been perhaps one or two of you are are realizing.
PS1BL|Oh oh.
KBMPSUN|that you could have done a bit more last year.
PS1BL|That's likely.
KBMPSUN|and it's even more noticeable once you go into the the year twelve that first twelve months is crucial if you just kick your heels and do nothing you'll find it very very difficult to work to pull up.
PS1BL|Is he finished this Finished this.
KBMPSUN|but whichever work you study.
PS1BL|Yeah all of it.
KBMPSUN|you know that is the erm two or three things there you're working by yourself in your your personal preparation prepa preparation are crucial parts erm if any of the people were thinking of going to erm erm a college erm the same sort of thing will arise and I suppose the big difference for if you don't have lessons then I think I'm right in saying you don't necessarily have to go in I don't know whether that still applies erm you would be expected of course to erm erm to turn up at school here erm now there are advantages and disadvantages you may feel that you prefer knowing on your own what you're like you'll prefer erm some fairly rigid rules erm because if there weren't rules you might think you'd take advantage of us.
PS1BL|You got rules here.
KBMPSUN|erm only that sort of rules probably a big advantage I think of staying in er sixth form is that erm you know the staff you know the system and it and they know you erm if you go to.
PS1BL|A big problem man.
KBMPSUN|you will take you a matter of months of course for you to settle in and those first few months are crucial again I maybe just mention this that you are aware of okay so that's.
PS1BL|Okay let's go.
PS1BL|eh What.
PS1BL|was a bit out of order we have nothing to do with it hmm.
PS1BN|What It was an accident.
PS1BL|hair leave the hair.
PS1BN|it was an accident.
PS1BL|Cor I bet.
PS1BP|You'd been planning it for about.
PS1BN|It just came out.
