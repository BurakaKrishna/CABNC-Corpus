PS1BV|Getting a job.
PS1BT|But you don't need a machine to do that You can count just like that.
PS1BV|And and well I'm just showing you them.
PS1BT|Right So.
PS1BV|Here.
PS1BT|Yes.
PS1BV|Seven twos That's two I got got it got it.
PS1BT|Right But you can count in twos.
PS1BV|Of course I can Two four six eight ten twelve.
PS1BT|After twelve.
PS1BV|Fourteen.
PS1BT|Then.
PS1BV|Sixteen.
PS1BT|Then.
PS1BV|Eighteen.
PS1BT|Then.
PS1BV|Twenty.
PS1BT|Then.
PS1BV|Twenty two.
PS1BT|Mm You're having to think about it Off then.
PS1BV|Clear.
PS1BT|So can you do ninety nines Keep adding ninety nines together.
PS1BV|Wait.
PS1BT|What's two ninety nines That's right Oh No now it gets useful doesn't it When you're dealing in bigger figures.
PS1BV|All the.
PS1BT|than you can do in your mind.
PS1BV|all the all the numbers.
PS1BT|Mm Right read me that number.
PS1BV|Two hundred and sixty nine.
PS1BT|Start again.
PS1BV|A hundred and two sixty nine.
PS1BT|How do you get that I number one is what does it say at the end.
PS1BV|Nothing there Full stop.
PS1BT|It says two O seven nine.
PS1BV|Oh Two O seven nine.
PS1BT|Which is What does that make.
PS1BV|It's the number of a steam engine I've got.
PS1BT|I'm not bothered whether it's a number of a steam engine but how do you pronounce that number.
PS1BV|Two hundred a.
PS1BT|No No.
PS1BV|two.
PS1BT|If it was that number it would be hundreds It's bigger than hundreds so what's that.
PS1BV|Er thousands.
PS1BT|Right So how many thousands.
PS1BV|Two thousand and seventy nine.
PS1BT|Well you got there in the end didn't you.
PS1BV|Right.
PS1BT|Right.
PS1BV|Now it's even more difficult Even more difficult Equals.
PS1BT|Yeah very clever You can add up in what are you doing up in tens.
PS1BV|Tens.
PS1BT|You can do that Ten twenty thirty forty can't you.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BT|What comes next.
PS1BV|Fifty sixty.
PS1BT|Then.
PS1BV|seventy eighty ninety twenty.
PS1BT|Ah ah Ninety.
PS1BV|A hundred.
PS1BT|That's better And add up in hundreds now.
PS1BV|A hundred twenty.
PS1BT|No A.
PS1BV|a hundred billi.
PS1BT|No start off.
PS1BV|Erm.
PS1BT|with a hundred and then add another hundred what do you get.
PS1BV|I'm trying to work my way to the end.
PS1BT|Now you're being a pickle Not not with the machine Using your own head Add add hundreds up Come on What do you start with.
PS1BV|A hundred a hundred and one and.
PS1BT|No No no no no I was I wasn't meaning you to go up in single numbers I was meaning go up in hundreds Start off with a hundred.
PS1BV|Yes A hundred.
PS1BT|Then add add the same again.
PS1BV|Two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred six hundred seven hundred eight hundred nine hundred ten hundred.
PS1BT|But what's ten hundred.
PS1BV|A thousand.
PS1BT|Right So why didn't you say that.
PS1BV|You didn't yo.
PS1BT|I I did I was expecting you to count nobody says ten hundred Do they.
PS1BV|No It always goes onto the next number Every number ga always goes up to nine.
PS1BT|Then it triggers over into another one doesn't it.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BT|Now what were we saying the other day You have units tens hundreds thousands.
PS1BV|But Dad.
PS1BT|don't you.
PS1BV|but three er there Check that number Ha That was stupid Yeah.
PS1BT|Mm mm So Mrs was showing you how to do this.
PS1BV|Right Yes.
PS1BT|What what else have you learnt to do with a calculator If you had four things.
PS1BV|Yes If I give them.
PS1BT|and you wanted to divide them among four people.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BT|how many would each person get.
PS1BV|But I don I I I didn't quite get the question.
PS1BT|If you had four things and you wanted to divide them between four people.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BT|how many would each person get.
PS1BV|Two No one.
PS1BT|That's better Now you did that without a calculator didn't you.
PS1BV|Oh I see.
PS1BT|Right now this time do it with the calculator So you've got.
PS1BV|Four turn it on.
PS1BT|Turn it on You run out of light There are Now you're on Which figure do you want No No You're dividing.
PS1BV|Which one's divide.
PS1BT|That one Divide by.
PS1BV|Four.
PS1BT|Yes That's right Equals Right Now that wa that time that's easy That just proves what you already know.
PS1BV|Right dad I'll show you something else.
PS1BT|No I was going to do more.
PS1BV|But I wa I want to show you something that's all.
PS1BT|Go on then Nine fifty six square root.
PS1BV|Er.
PS1BT|Who taught you that.
PS1BV|Well I lis no one It's Mrs said to Mark.
PS1BT|Just a minute.
PS1BV|he he he was getting the controls wrong He pressed square root instead of equals.
PS1BT|Yes And so you've discovered.
PS1BV|Eh.
PS1BT|the square root of ninety six is nine point seven nine seven nine five eight nine But do you know what square root means.
PS1BV|What.
PS1BT|Well the square root of a number.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BT|is the number which if multiplied by itself.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BT|gives you back the number you started with Take for the easiest one is four The square root of four is two Try it on your machine.
PS1BV|Right What do I press.
PS1BT|Four four square root and it gives you two Because two times two gives you four Try the square root of nine Just press clear.
PS1BV|Yeah I just press this one.
PS1BT|Yes Clear that bit.
PS1BV|Cos it clears the whole mind.
PS1BT|Right.
PS1BV|What shall I press.
PS1BT|Nine square root is three So if you multiply three times three you get nine Now it's easy when you deal in numbers like that because if you go to sixteen.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BT|the square root is four.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BT|And if you go to twenty five the square root is five That's the number which multiplied by its self.
PS1BV|Right.
PS1BT|gives you the number Now now it gets difficult when you come to a number like six.
PS1BV|Oh yes.
PS1BT|Try and find the square root of six What do you think have you an idea of what it will be Don't don't press the button Six.
PS1BV|Er er.
PS1BT|What what number do you think you'd have to multiply by itself to get six.
PS1BV|Three.
PS1BT|No Three times three is.
PS1BV|I don six six It's three.
PS1BT|No Three times three.
PS1BV|I don't know the answer.
PS1BT|Well look three three and three So how many have you got.
PS1BV|Ten.
PS1BT|No Plonker You've got nine.
PS1BV|I'm just going.
PS1BT|Anyway.
PS1BV|to check.
PS1BT|So there you are It's two point four four nine which really is very close to two and a half Which isn't quite right.
PS1BT|Oh that well that's the square root of the other one so you're you're going to smaller square roots every time That gets very difficult.
PS1BV|Right.
PS1BT|Right So clear all that and go back to what you wanted to do.
PS1BV|Right I'll show you Ten square root is.
PS1BT|Three point one six two two seven seven six.
PS1BV|Right Eh eh.
PS1BT|Four hundred and fifty six square root is twenty one point three five four one five six Very clever Useless for you though You don't really need that information do you.
PS1BV|Well dad.
PS1BT|So what what what sort of information do you need.
PS1BV|Tt Counting information.
PS1BT|Well if you went out doing your favourite hobby.
PS1BV|Yes an engine.
PS1BT|Pardon.
PS1BV|Getting in an engine.
PS1BT|Driving an engine Now how would sums come into that.
PS1BV|What You can't get sums in an engine's smoke box.
PS1BT|Mm You could if they would burn.
PS1BT|Well you co.
PS1BV|I I want to get clever with you.
PS1BT|Oh I thought you had been Shall we turn that off now then.
