PS1BV|I thought er.
PS1BS|Cos it's usually the er the tender engines don't pull caravan do they.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BS|It's only the tankers isn't it.
PS1BV|But mum Look you can't get the express coaches.
PS1BS|No.
PS1BV|But mum.
PS1BS|Why why.
PS1BV|Mum.
PS1BS|I just think Tom's looking very battered The cabs are very chipped It's I think you have to take a bit more care of those Cos you will throw them at the back of the box instead of lining them upD' ya remember how I got that box where you could lay them in separately And of course you're not being very careful You're not a very careful with your toys young man are you.

PS1BV|All over.
PS1BS|the board that you set out the Lego on you could run those on that That's taking up enough room.
PS1BV|It is.
PS1BS|we do I don't think we've got any more space.
PS1BV|The board's damaged from cos that board's damaged beca from Duck from Duck to Diesel.
PS1BS|D' ya know I'd forgotten it's got dirty beads on It's a long time since you've had this set out.

PS1BV|But mum.
PS1BS|But I don't think the Fat Controller's supposed to be quite as nice is he Are you finding they're not particularly.
PS1BV|Mine are all staying there.
PS1BS|Oh.
PS1BS|Yeah.
PS1BV|You know these two they cos they set don't they.
PS1BS|They come together yes But I think you've got different sizes there.
PS1BV|Well mum.
PS1BS|And probably only bigger ones.
PS1BV|they came as the same they came in the same colour mu thing round them we in the red letters saying what they are.
PS1BS|Mm The same packaging.
PS1BV|Yeah Same package package.
PS1BS|Mm mm Cos you can get the bigger.
PS1BV|Mm mm.
PS1BS|got the bigger Thomas haven't you Got two of them the one that that pushes one round.
PS1BV|Hey mum You you can get a toy the same as the Fat Controller there.
PS1BS|Mm mm.
PS1BV|A really big one that big They're that big.
PS1BS|Well I don't I haven't seen one that size.
PS1BV|That big.
PS1BS|It's probably yes Maybe a bit smaller.
PS1BV|No Bu I think it's Fat Controller bubble bath.
PS1BS|Oh I see what you mean.
PS1BV|I think.
PS1BS|Yeah.
PS1BV|I think it is Well I think it was made of a squidgy thing.
PS1BS|Now I was only thinking this morning when I was in your bathroom you've got lots of bubble bath left over from Christmas You've still got some left over from the year before but people keep giving you it.
PS1BV|Mm.
PS1BS|Chrissy's still got that turtle bubble bath that he doesn't want anybody to use And you've got the same one And then er pots with the squidgy soap in.
PS1BV|Oh yeah.
PS1BS|And then there's another tall bottle that Wendy got you You've still got the lot from last year that David and Wendy got you and you've.
PS1BV|You soap.
PS1BS|still got this year's I think it's about time you used some of that.
PS1BV|I I'm the only person who used the squidgy soap.
PS1BS|Didn't we have to stop using it because Chrissy was coming out in a rash.
PS1BV|No No.
PS1BS|And we didn't know what it was.
PS1BV|No because I was ha because I had the diarrhoea.
PS1BS|Did you.
PS1BV|Yeah That was the reason we that was when we stopped using the turtle stuff.
PS1BS|D' ya know I don't know.
PS1BV|Mm mm.
PS1BS|Well we'll start using it again Start using the stuff ta cos there's another big bottle in the cupboard as well in your bathroom.
PS1BV|Yes.
PS1BS|No point in saving it You may as well use it.
PS1BV|Mm mm Mum.
PS1BS|Yes.
PS1BV|You know of that music which goes with the engines.
PS1BS|Mm.
PS1BV|Well as soon as you know knowing it too well.
PS1BS|Oh we must make sure on Tuesday we're home to record what time is the on It starts at five to four doesn't it I must get the tape lined up so that it's ready to switch on when we come home cos it's gon na be walk home from school if it's a nice day we'll we'll have to hurry home Cos we usually walk slowly don't we So we're not getting home till about fouro'clock But if we we erm.
PS1BV|Hurry.
PS1BS|Well if it's if it's if the weather's not very good I'll meet you in the car but if it's a nice day I I'd much rather walk to meet you.
PS1BV|But mum we did go in th the car You said it's erm at five past five.
PS1BS|No we we walked and I I got the time wrong didn't we Cos we came in and Chrissy instead of switching on the children's programmes put his computer on so we didn't see it.
PS1BV|Well we.
PS1BS|But of course it's five to four isn't it It's the beginning of the programmes rather than the end Never mind We've only missed one.
PS1BV|Mum.
PS1BS|I hadn't even got the tape lined up ready to the next the next one on So I'll have to get it set up ready for when I meet you from school and then we can switch it on as soon as we get home.
PS1BV|Well that's what Chrissy did see.
PS1BS|Well we'll remember The Tuesday after that we go on holiday it's the Easter holidays.
PS1BV|Can you move your foot mum.
PS1BS|I'm sorry.
PS1BV|You're ri you're right on the railway.
PS1BS|I'm standing on the railway Oh I better move out the way I might get squashed If we got this Monopoly game finished we could get this cleared up couldn't we It's been going on a few days this game I think Chrissy's got a although I'm not sure actually you might win You've got two sets haven't you And quite a lot of money Have you got houses on your set Yes you have You've got a house on I started off quite well I've got Mayfair Piccadilly Fleet Street and Regent Street but I never got a set did I.
PS1BV|Mum how much how much do you want for Fleet Street.
PS1BS|Well.
PS1BV|Then I'll have just three sets.
PS1BS|Yes If I land on something where I need some money Chris has got quite a lot of he's got Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road Although they don't cost much to buy though a few houses on them You can earn some money So I might need if I land on that I'll probably have to sell Fleet Street to be able to survive And I think once I do that I shall have lost out because Chris has got Park Lane and he's not going to part with those So I don't think I'm going to do very well.
PS1BV|Mum.
PS1BS|Yes Mind.
