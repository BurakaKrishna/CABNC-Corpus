PS0E8|I sh- think you've only got to leave it till it's melted has it melted.
PS0E9|Yeah.
PS0E8|Oh well switch it off then.
PS0E8|Well I've turned it down and then it blew out there right.
PS0E8|Now be careful.
PS0E9|It's difficult.
PS0E8|Oh well I mean I really didn't need this at the moment with daddy coming in and everything.
PS0E8|Well can you put that that tine of biscuits away.
PS0E9|Oh I know how to do that I.
PS0E8|Cos I don't want it all over the floor.
PS0EA|Can I have a little go now.
PS0E8|Well I should let Clare do this it's not very easy.
PS0EA|Oh Clare promised me I cooked one.
PS0E9|Quick go but you won't be able to do it.
PS0E8|Go on then.
PS0E8|You've got to press it hard.
