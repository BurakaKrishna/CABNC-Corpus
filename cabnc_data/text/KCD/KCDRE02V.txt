PS6ST|Well it seems to me if you cut it if you put that one there then this other piece it'll use to do in there.
PS0E8|What other piece.
PS6ST|Well if we cut a piece round there.
PS0E8|Yeah.
PS6ST|And the other piece that we got could do that one that piece in there.
PS0E8|Ah you not yes alright.
PS6ST|Ok.
PS0E8|Well I mean half a bottle to do the top and the down you can do that bit measure if you like.
PS6ST|Yeah ok if you can measure it then I can cut off.
PS0E8|Can't tell whether that's going to reach or not I don't think it is I think no I think you've got to come down another pattern Oh that one down then.
PS6ST|Got what you want.
PS0E8|Yeah.
PS0E8|Couldn't really see in the corner whether it was going so tight Shall I go and get the other scissors out of the cut the right side.
PS6ST|Yes.
