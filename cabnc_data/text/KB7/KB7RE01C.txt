PS02G|you see put John one of us start trussing early but we didn't need one Ann's got another team in the other room doing it.
PS039|There still in there.
PS02G|I'll I'll be finished before long.
PS039|Yeah.
PS02G|Well about another hour.
PS039|Have we got some more Birds Eye pies up to truss.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02G|they didn't do them Actually they perhaps let us go back on them then.
PS039|Well.
PS02G|tomorrow.
PS039|if you do that I think perhaps that's the best kind of action have a word with him and go down I mean.
PS02G|You mean go back on them cos we didn't finish them cos there was three pallets and we didn't even do two.
PS039|There's only twelve with a last week weren't there.
PS02G|We didn't finish them cos they wanted to start trussing early.
PS039|It's what you had last week.
PS02G|and then Ann started that little line trussing you see so we've done it between us but I've got a thousand to do and she's got about four d t.
PS039|Ann even if they do some.
PS02G|I bet you feel like a now give them in when they can't truss them du n no.
PS039|That I've only had.
PS02G|We give them in when they came trussed with the though we had before.
PS039|It's not very heavy Really to start a truss that's.
PS02G|Well with the two lines going yeah would have been about right then but see John I don't suppose he realised Ann was gon na fetch all the people out of here there and everywhere and start that up.
PS039|What did he do did he say.
PS02G|Well I pa.
PS039|Ann.
PS02G|No.
PS02G|no so she started trussing helping me.
PS039|Yeah yeah but he wouldn't.
PS02G|I suppose that's what John thought we might not get them done start early and get them finished.
PS039|That's good.
PS02G|He just said leave the Bird's Eye pies and start your trussing.
PS039|That was gone seveno'clock when.

PS02G|That's it.
PS039|You're not forgiven.

PS6TB|Oh right.
PS02G|not in the factory I didn't li I could of asked Tom.
PS6TB|What in here.
PS02G|Everywhere I go.
PS6TB|Oh I shall be quiet.
PS02G|It's all anonymous you're not e e e nobody know who it is it's for it's for a dictionary and they want new words that are commonly used and they don't want and all old words that never get used it'll be dropped in the next edition of the dictionary.
PS039|I go I anything.
PS02G|No it's er I'm taping all my conversations I have with everybody for a week.
PS039|What if people don't want you to.
PS02G|Oh yeah you you have to erase it but nobody's gon na sa I mean to say nobody knows who you are what you've said anyway at all do they.
PS039|Well I don't know if you're just gon na write down.
PS02G|What.
PS039|what you put on there and that.
PS02G|I don't write anything I send the tape in they don't know who you are you're just a it's just a voice speaking nobody knows who you are or anything they only know me nobody else.
PS039|then.
PS02G|Why Who's who's gon na know when they lis to compile a dictionary and what words you use who's gon na know who you are.
PS039|Ha du n no speaking.
PS02G|That's all well if you want it erased I will I mean it's up to you entirely.
PS6TB|Well you won't have any trouble with Jeanie.
PS02G|but.
PS02G|Ay I I've I've said that to them I said well you might have if I take to work you'll certainly hear some they said tha well if that's common usage words that's what it has to be and words that we never use at all that are in dictionaries and nobody ever uses them they want to know common ordinary speech words that we use.
PS6TB|Can't get more common than me.
PS02G|Ey I told them I said you might hear some right a I was in the pub Saturday night mind I did tell afterwards and he's ever such a nice bl fella he comes over door.
PS02G|so he's killing himself laughing I I've got to tell you Ron I've been taping he said I don't give a monkeys you tape what he said let them all hear they'll all be able to pass it round.
PS6TB|It ain't well it wasn't really disgusting but it.
PS02G|Are you ready.
PS039|said he wouldn't.
PS02G|I said I got a good joke for you here started to laugh and he said I ain't said it yet Well I didn't tell him it he can wind it just erase it I mean I don't I said I'm alright love just to do all that I've got twenty tapes Someone asked me whether I thought it'd be a bit of fun But as I say nobody knows who you are or what you've said or anything so it doesn't matter does it It's the words they're interested in not what you actually say and the.
PS02G|words that yo people are using I've got now so I don't even think of it it's just there and I just talk normal that's the idea really and if anybody asks you what you're doing then you tell them and it and you say if you don't wish to be on it well.
PS02G|wipe it off but nobody knows who you are anyway so what difference does it make Unless it got personal I'd turn it off I mean I mean when we went the estate agents and solicitors.
PS039|Be Alan be Alan Whicker.
PS02G|sort of sit there putting what the solicitor said in your.
PS02G|turn them off.
PS02G|Or if anybody told me I mean I wouldn't and talking in confidence about their private life or.
PS039|No.
PS02G|just turn them off and that's it Just normal conversations the words that people use in common different areas of the country with accents and th dialect and one thing and another it's for the Oxford English Dictionary the next edition.
PS039|It is very old.
