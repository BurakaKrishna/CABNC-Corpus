PS02H|I mean it might might just sway as to one way or the other if there's a bit of a well we like them both but which one you know.
PS02G|I don't wan na get carpets without you with me cos you have to live with them as well.
PS02H|I can have a look at them now in the catalogue.
PS02G|Yeah but they won't be exactly the same in shops.
PS02H|No true.
PS02G|Similar but not the same.
PS02H|No not the same that's true Mind you I suppose out of a catalogue it's at least you can feel them and see them all that.
PS02G|Oh and I'd rather.
PS02H|Only on see the whole roll.
PS02G|I'd rather go in the shop and see it cos sometimes especially if it's got a pattern on turn out to be better than the catalogue cos when it comes it don't look the same and then the same colour do you Cos a reproduction's never perfect is it.
PS02H|No.
PS02G|In a photograph it's never true then you go in a shop and what you see is what you get.
