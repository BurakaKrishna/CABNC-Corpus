PS02G|How would you like that Order's not completed you've got to stay till it is.
PS02H|Up yours mate I'm going home Teno'clock and that's it Or whatever.
PS02G|Not many would Very rare.
PS02H|Not often.
PS02G|Oh my god.
PS02G|I had that yesterday What's our post code.
PS02H|P E fourteen seven P G.
PS02G|They was looking for it on a list.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|Said I know it's P fourteen I don't know the rest of it And he looked on a list he had and he put seven something.
PS02H|Seven P G I can always remember it.
PS02G|Well you're good at remembering numbers.
PS02H|Well yeah but I just think P E fourteen half of fourteen is seven and then T G.
PS02G|Yes darling.
PS02H|So that's how I remember it Funny in n it.
PS02G|Yes very strange but you are strange.
PS02H|I know yes.
PS02H|Very strange yeah very strange.
PS02G|You always remember numbers Don't you Car numbers and telephone numbers and.
PS02H|Car numbers I remember more by the letters than the numbers Because there are s specific set numbers Once I see.
PS02G|When they come round at work and says this car blocked in I say oh go and ask Stuart he'll probably know Give you a blooming it's a blue something or other and this is the number Go and ask I said go and Stuart or Bill they they know most of them I wouldn't know one from another.
PS02H|associated the letters with the car and the letters with the car go together And then the numbers the numbers I don't remember that well Some of them I do now with them changing the the changeover cos they always used to be the letters followed by the numbers Now they've got the initial letter followed by the number then the letters Rather than so As I say you associate the car and the number together.
PS02G|I don't.
PS02H|It would probably throw me completely If you.
PS02H|it would throw me completely if you put if you changed some of the number plates over If you put Tina's number plate on another car and visa versa that would throw I I'd probably look at it and think you know oh somebody's got a new car or that looks familiar but it's not the right car so I wouldn't think about it Even though I know Tina's is C two one one Y C L if it was on a different car I'd probably look at it and think.
PS02G|Oh that's not right.
PS02H|it's not right it's not Tina's And so I wouldn't think that that I probably Just a just a trait of personality.
PS02G|I wonder how she is if she's at work or at home.
PS02H|Don't really don't really care to tell you the truth in a way but.
PS02G|Oh that's nice.
PS02H|Well no I care I care if Tina's not well and hope she gets better soon but I don't care if.
PS02G|You don't care about work getting in a muddle.
PS02H|I don't care about work and them being in a muddle no not at all.
PS02H|Let them get on with it.
PS02G|That's not very nice.
PS02H|It is.
PS02G|No it isn't.
PS02H|Well it is Why isn't it.
PS02G|Cos it isn't.
PS02H|Well.
PS02H|if a lot of others were off we'd have to cope somehow wouldn't we So there you go Just cos we're off And possibly Tina and that is off so they'll just have to struggle on as if we were there and a lot of others were off Don't you agree.
PS02G|Yes darling.
PS02H|Right So what's on the agenda for today.
PS02G|Well you know very well We are going shopping.
PS02H|Where are we going shopping.
PS02G|Whenever you're ready to take me shopping.
PS02H|But where are we going shopping.
PS02G|Well probably Wisbech No point in going to Lynn if we're going to mum's.
PS02H|No but where.
PS02G|Wherever you wish to take me.
PS02H|Where would Ann want to go.
PS02G|I don't mind Haven't got a lot of choice I don't like Tescos at Wisbech cos it's.
PS02H|Right.
PS02G|So it's Gateway Gateway or blooming Rainbow Suppose we could go down the Rainbow and have a look at that microwave But I'll have to go into town first Cos I don't think they'll give me the shopping for nothing and there's no bank down Rainbow Well there is a Co-op bank but I don't think they'll let me have some money out of it.
PS02H|Mm Maybe not.
PS02G|And seeing as I haven't got an account with them I don't think they'll say well you can have some anyway.
PS02H|No.
PS02G|No.
PS02H|And then we're going into town Well we've got to go into town.
PS02G|Got to see the estate agents and see if we can view something today.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|other ones that we are definitely interested in and underneath the ones that we are not so interested in.
PS02H|Yeah there's one down that one down Elizabeth Terrace I was just trying to figure out which one it is Hundred and twenty.
PS02G|I don't know if that isn't erm what they call it who died not long ago Hazel's mum's Cos perhaps the dad's moved out or you know Quite close to her Oh what was her name Old Hazel's mother.
PS02H|Hazel's mother.
PS02G|The little old lady who went to Salvation Army always wearing a little hat Oh what was her name Cos you know her as well And I said oh my god she's died and you said oh I know her.
PS02H|What used to go to the Salvation Army.
PS02G|She was to Salvation Army Ever so small little lady or something I can remember her kids and I can't remember her name Terrible Hazel and Terry mother-in-law's brother Terry fire officer at Wisbech it's his mother-in-law laws And she died not more than a few months ago.
PS02G|Oh it's awful It's dreadful I mean quite fond of her.
PS02H|Just trying to think which one it was anyway.
PS02G|I think it's her house.
PS02H|Yeah but I'm trying think which one it is Cos I say I know that I know Elizabeth Terrace well.
PS02G|Yeah I know cos I think you called on her cos you knew her When she died you said oh I know her well.
PS02H|Hundred and twenty Let's go and have a look Oh it's in here somewhere in n it.
PS02G|I put a ring round it so I know.
PS02H|Oh yeah here we are hundred and twenty Ah the one one in from the end Yeah I know the one now One in from the end.
PS02G|I think that is her house Mind she had a husband but should think he living with one of the kids.
PS02H|Can't think who lived there now God cos I used to call on that one perhaps The only trouble down Elizabeth Terrace parking.
PS02H|That's the only trouble The only consolation if.
PS02G|the college.
PS02H|if that was a possibility or if that became a possibility mum only live round the corner Not that far away is she Few hundred yards.
PS02G|She drives.
PS02H|And I could leave the car in her driveway.
PS02G|Then there's the college Lot of people park in the college Don't they.
PS02H|So that is a possi I was just wondering which one it was cos I say I know some of them are a bit you know.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|a bit dodgy I knew there there they had a lot of trouble with one of them but nearer Helen's end There was one there that was empty and for a long long while The builders started building knocking it about.
PS02G|And it fell to bits.
PS02H|And then it.
PS02H|and then no the ran out of money The builder ran out of money and the it was just a shell You know nothing in it No windows no doors no nothing er you know completely gutted it to make it all to renovate it and then ran out of money and then it just stood there completely empty And can you imagine a house in the open air in winter.
PS02G|Do it a lot of good would it.
PS02H|It wouldn't do it a lot of good no exactly.
PS02G|Woodwork and.
PS02H|exactly.
PS02G|and even the brickwork.
PS02H|No.
PS02G|damp and If you get me back to mum's for about threeo'clock time at the latest to take her to Osborne House.
PS02H|Well that's what she's that's what she's she's she just sort of she didn't mean it but.
PS02G|No it.
PS02H|it was her thought that we were.
PS02G|Yeah cos I mean you'd probably run her back rather than her biking As I say I mean we if we could make an appointment say three fifteen or three thirty to see Sefton Avenue Cos we'd be up there anyway.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Wouldn't we Before it gets dark and you couldn't see anything anyway.
PS02H|Oh we'd have to go and have a look in the light.
PS02G|Well that's it.
PS02H|Definitely.
PS02G|cos you can't see a lot Cos there won't be electricity on Anyway you wan na have a good look round seriously consider it Cos I think now we haven't heard from Mr and I think that means he's not prepared to take it so he's not bothered about coming Yeah Is that the way you're reading it.
PS02H|That's the way I'm reading it I'm.
PS02G|Ignore it cos the man might just leave him in there renting it until or when forever it goes up But we can't afford it to go up.
PS02H|I'm disappointed that he's not been back.
PS02G|Yeah I am.
PS02H|to discuss it.
PS02G|Yeah I am.
PS02H|And to put the position to him Look the market's not very good I know but we're sitting tenants We're quite happy to take it on We'd like to take it on If we leave have you got another tenant to come in You're gon na lose two hundred and fifty pound a month And a good two hundred and fifty pound a month.
PS02G|Exactly.
PS02H|You know not one that he has any hassle in getting.
PS02G|That's it He don't have to keep calling and wandering around after us But I'm not prepared to go on renting it.
PS02H|No no.
PS02G|As you say three thousand pound a year that could be paid off a place of our own is is just I mean if I have to rent it well I'll have to rent one If we can't get anything else and we can't afford anything else we've just got to go on paying it but.
PS02H|But.
PS02G|when there's so much other.
PS02H|as I say you look at I mean this is two fifty You look here in the paper and see how much they are.
PS02G|Yeah I know Some of them are terrible.
PS02H|You're talking two sixty two eighty.
PS02G|I know Three hundred.
PS02H|To let Three seventy.
PS02G|No.
PS02H|Detached four bedroomed house admittedly Granary Two b two two bed.
PS02G|That's the one I fancy If I went anywhere into another flat I'd quite fancy going into.
PS02H|Two bed second floor self-contained flat Living room kitchen bathroom twelve months two seventy five unfurnished.
PS02G|Mm I know.
PS02H|Armada Close two eighty Norfolk Street two eighty.
PS02G|Mm I wouldn't I wouldn't go in to Armada Close I don't think.
PS02H|That's furnished Six months Two eighty.
PS02G|Yeah well you see furnished you see they can charge extra.
PS02H|Norfolk Street self-contained principally first floor flat two bedrooms furnished two eighty.
PS02G|I wouldn't want a furnished one now.
PS02H|No of course not But as I say.
PS02G|I know they are expensive Which is why I.
PS02H|Two sixty two eighty which is the same price as.
PS02G|which which is why now er that Rose and Jean when they considered it Mum said how about renting one in Wisbech but I said well if she can't afford a mortgage you can't afford to rent one Not anything that's worth living in.
PS02H|No.
PS02G|fifty quid a week ones are er forty pound a week and so on You gets what you pay for which nowadays isn't a lot not for that money You know when I asked was gon na have er on Lynn Road there what was that fifty a fifty a week I mean it was.
PS02H|Fifty or fifty five weren't it.
PS02G|it was clean but that's about all you could say.
PS02H|Is that the one Ann is in now Or in that area.
PS02G|I don't know where Ann is No I think she's down Victoria Road somewhere She won't tell anybody But I think she lives somewhere down Victoria Road I don't know She's only in a bedsit.
PS02H|Yeah But I mean you see her up town though.
PS02G|I know That's cos she's lonely and she just wanders about She gets up.
PS02G|don't want to stay in the bedsit One room she she shares a bathroom and kitchen She just goes for a walk I mean she's seeing people and.
PS02H|Yeah but I mean the times I've seen her it's been this end of town rather than that end of town Which has made which which just makes me think.
PS02G|I don't really I just presume she lives down Victoria Road somewhere but I don't really know.
PS02H|And she walks to work.
PS02G|She couldn't do any other She hasn't got a vehicle she can't afford one.
PS02H|No no But that just makes me think why that's what makes me think she's living.
PS02G|She could be But that weren't a bedsitter that I was in Shared bathroom but I.
PS02H|No but yeah.
PS02G|but it was a kitchen and bedroom and living room They're only tiny like an alcove bedroom but.
PS02H|Oh yeah I've been in one of them You know I've seen them.
PS02G|I mean it was the only one with a with its own kitchen The one that I was gon na have.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|This was right up the top and there were a tiny attic bedroom thing was made into a not very salubrious but it had a cooker and a sink.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|And as I say that was fifty or something a week and it wasn't wasn't worth it really.
PS02H|No.
PS02G|Furniture wasn't that posh but then er but the only thing I thought about it was safe and it was clean Needed a bit of personalizing but it was it was old-fashioned furniture but it was polished It was clean Had a reasonable carpet on the floor and and so on.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|But it wasn't worth fifty pound a week Definitely not.
PS02H|But that's what they're going for though isn't it If they can get them for that.
PS02G|people do People are desperate to buy and they'll have whatever and they have to pay.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|When you think that one what was thirty three thousand two hundred and sixty a month or something wasn't it Well that's gon na be about two hundred and forty two hundred and fifty a month for that one down Cos thirty three worked out two sixty didn't it.
PS02H|Oh the mortgage you mean.
PS02G|Mortgage So you can say two hundred and fifty pound a month to buy a place.
PS02H|Oh yeah.
PS02G|And yet they want two eighty to rent one Seems quite ridiculous.
PS02H|Well that's if you're prepared to buy a flat That's the only thing isn't it If you're prepared to buy a flat.
PS02G|Yeah but at least you've got actually got the property haven't you You're not just paying somebody else to have a Cos if you're moving if you can't sell it you can always rent it again Which is what a lot of people are doing houses especially They buy a house cos they've had a child or something They can't afford to they can't sell that one so they rent that out which pays the mortgage for it and start again on another mortgage.
PS02H|You've got to be a bit careful when you're renting out though.
PS02G|Oh yes Got to be careful of your tenants pay.
PS02H|Tenants.
PS02G|That's why it's best to go through an agency or er something like White and Eddies because they have people that collect them and they have people who have to take up references and.
PS02H|Yeah but not only that but I mean if you.
PS02G|And they have they have proper leases I mean after that they're out and.
PS02H|Yeah well I mean all all well it counts towards your income as well.
PS02G|Oh yeah I know Oh yeah income tax on it.
PS02H|Counts counts towards your income.
PS02G|But a lot of people are doing it.
PS02H|Mm Oh I know Well there's for one sell.
PS02G|Lot of people are doing it because they just can't well circumstances It's either the job or something means they've got ta go away or they can't afford they can't sell them so they I don't know if that would make your income different if you were still paying a mortgage.
PS02G|Even though your all the money.
PS02H|Think.
PS02G|you were getting in was getting paid out again.
PS02H|I think you'll find it counts towards your income So I mean if you had a job.
PS02G|Paying them more tax.
PS02H|You you got a job say you're earning.
PS02G|But I think the expenses when you're.
PS02H|earning ten thousand a year And you're going you're getting two hundred and fifty pound a month as well in rent.
PS02G|Yeah but you you'd be able to claim expenses.
PS02H|I think so yeah.
PS02G|You wouldn't pay the whole of it taxable if it was you know you would claim expenses for one thing and another.
PS02H|Oh I don't know but I mean I wouldn't have thought so Yeah.
PS02G|Otherwise probably that's why they are dear because they have to do things like that.
PS02H|That's probably why they're the price they are two eighty.
PS02G|That's it.
PS02H|Because people take.
PS02G|Pay fifty and thirty quid a week more is a bloody what they get stopped off them.
PS02H|and people have taken out big mortgages like Tina And to pay off the mortgage they've got to charge so much.
PS02G|I mean Tina's got that little house I mean now you'd get it two hundred and fi I mean Tina pays two hundred and forty eight er pound a week a month Three hundred and forty eight pound a month mortgage on that little house.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|I mean that was bloody thirty nine thousand or was it forty one when she had it It was.
PS02H|I know.
PS02G|forty one I think I mean now they're going for thirty two We can afford one like that.
PS02H|Yeah we could isn't it.
PS02G|Mm They don't sell now Not selling at all There's a few renting now cos they can't sell them So It's a nice enough little house but I'm not awfully keen on it are you.
PS02H|I don't like the I don't like the bedroom.
PS02G|No I don't.
PS02H|situation for one.
PS02G|If it had a door and a wall and.
PS02H|You're just straight upstairs and you fall into bed.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|Handy I suppose but.
PS02H|In some respects but I mean it just doesn't I mean in a way I suppose well with Tina being a non smoker and Wiggie being a non smoker.
PS02G|It's not so bad.
PS02H|isn't so bad but I mean if you're like us and I mean the smoke's just.
PS02G|That's it That's why Tina doesn't like people smoking in her house because it gets into her bedroom.
PS02H|Yes Exactly The smoke would just rise straight up and.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|straight up into the bedroom I mean she doesn't smoke anyway so I mean you know.
PS02G|She doesn't like people smoking in her house Because she says I don't want my bedroom smelling of smoke her sheets and everything else.
PS02H|She would do.
PS02G|Mind you they have done a bit more to it since Wiggie's been there in as much as she's had a big curtain put across.
PS02H|Oh yeah Across the top of the stairs like or.
PS02G|All the way across Because Steve couldn't sleep.
PS02H|Because of the light in that little.
PS02G|Because it's light See you'd even the patio door light went.
PS02H|Straight upstairs.
PS02G|straight upstairs.
PS02H|And that.
PS02G|Because he's and then.
PS02H|skylight Mm yeah.
PS02G|skylight He's had a blind put up a special blind that leads straight across the fanlight And she's had curtains big track put across so that sh.
PS02H|She can shut it off.
PS02G|she can shut it right off She couldn't she just wasn't sleeping Said was broad daylight.
PS02H|Mhm.
PS02G|She said oh he you know we've had all that done Tracked across the ceiling so that shut the off She said he just couldn't sleep in there.
PS02H|With the light.
PS02G|With all the lights and daylight and sunshine through the bloody thing and It was alright once he got off but he had a job getting off when it was.
PS02H|Mm mm.
PS02G|as I say when it was sunlight shining through the bloody thing on his face Mm they've had a special they had a skylight blind made.
PS02H|Mm mm.
PS02G|They couldn't have an ordinary one cos it would hang down Has to be on a runners on the side as well otherwise it would just fall down.
PS02H|Side yeah so it fall.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|It's got a you know like a frame what you put in along.
PS02H|Like a venetian blind in a way.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|Or a straight down blind but at an angle but er but on runners to hold yeah.
PS02G|But it's got runners to hold the side in you see.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|I mean but Steven would but.
PS02H|Do they owe.
PS02G|the building society and erm.
PS02H|the building society Yeah.
PS02G|They'll have to pay another mortgage as well.
PS02H|Yeah but on the yeah but I mean if she sold it for thirty two she'd still owe them nine thousand wouldn't she.
PS02G|Well she must have paid a bit off She's been in there about three years.
PS02H|Yeah Well say she owes them nine thousand anyway.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|But then er if they wanted another mortgage it would be.
PS02G|That would be added to it you see.
PS02H|They'd probably have a fifty thousand pound mortgage to pay off the the existing mortgage on that one and the balance I mean they can afford it between them.
PS02G|Well I don't know I mean Steve must pay about eighty pounds a bloody week.
PS02H|Oh yeah of course Steven and his maintenance Maintenance.
PS02G|Maintenance and one thing and another.
PS02H|Yeah Yeah that would cut it down wouldn't it on their own you can say they'd be able to afford it but if you consider the outgoings as well eighty pound a.
PS02G|Mind you saying that three hundred fifty pound a month to buy a bigger mortgage anyway Nowadays.
PS02H|For the interest rate yeah but it would only buy the same sort of mortgage that Tina's got on it already.
PS02G|Yeah well that's what I mean They could have bought afford a.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|a a better property for about forty four thousand or whatever for the same money Cos that's how it's worked out.
PS02H|No cos she still owes if she sold it she'd still owe the balance between the selling price and.
PS02G|Yeah so she's got to buy a cheaper one and that would be added to it.
PS02H|That would be added to it you see.
PS02G|Mm and just his wages how much extra they could afford.
PS02H|That's it.
PS02G|I know Steven would like.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|He'd like one with a spare bedroom so the children can come and stop I mean Tina's worried now she's got his mother coming for christmas for a fortnight Don't know where the hell she'll sleep she's got to sleep in the living room.
PS02H|Mm But that's about fifty isn't it.
PS02G|Fifty two probably get the fifty.
PS02H|As I say you're looking at a.
PS02G|Hefty mortgage Tina reckons out of her wages she's got ninety ninety six pound a week out of her wages just for mortgage and.
PS02H|Expenses.
PS02G|expenses That's gone before she starts.
PS02H|And then out of Wiggie's he's got.
PS02G|Seventy five I think he pays It's a lot of money gone before you've even.
PS02H|Mhm before you even start Mm.
PS02G|Depends what you want most don't it I suppose.
PS02H|Mm mm That's true.
PS02G|She'd like to change the car I mean she never liked that car Ever She had a nice car before Chris made her have that more or less She didn't want it She hated it at first she wouldn't drive it Noisy and clumsy she didn't like it at all She never has really.
PS02H|It's not it's not a bad car is it.
PS02G|She doesn't like it Never been happy with it Never It was Chris's idea to have the diesel one and that model He talked her into it.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|But she hated it at first She'd do anything rather than drive it at first I don't know what she had before but it was a.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|Mind you it was quite old I think it was a car that she'd had for was well looked after her dad used to see to it for her but it was she'd had it for some years and she was always poodling about in you see And it was her second car that she'd ever had sort of thing.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|She'd had it five or six years or something like that You know think it was about ten year old when she got rid of it Something like that.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|But say it was a lovely little car really And she hated that.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|Times she used to go really hate it.
PS02H|Yeah if that one that Elizabeth Terrace one is is the one I think it is which is the one fairly near the end in that in that bottom bottom row I think the live in the first one they still live in the first one on the corner I'm not sure if they've moved actually now They may have done Got a funny feeling they have now But Who's that.
PS02G|Paper man.
PS02H|Bloody hell.
