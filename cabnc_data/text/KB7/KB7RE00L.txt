PS6TB|I love them I love.
PS02G|Luckily I'm not over.
PS6TB|I love.
PS02G|keen.
PS6TB|I love a piece of orange I I wouldn't eat a whole orange but I do like er little pieces of oranges now I might get away with that but if I was to have a whole orange.
PS02G|I just get if someone.
PS6TB|No.
PS02G|if you sat there peeling an orange and some of the juice squirted on me I'd I'd blister.
PS6TB|Mm.
PS02G|Sore it gets.
PS02H|Eighty five.
PS02G|I wouldn't dare eat them I'd be in a terrible state.
PS6TB|Yeah I'm like that but we had a erm conifer type tree it was only so big but and then I and when we we was unloading off the van this come off and I dug a hole and stuck it in the garden in the front garden just by the pathways right that's that but I was washing the car one day a nice hot day got my shirt off when I come in course I'd brushed past it I'd got patterns of the leaves on my on my back.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|I mean my mate he went to hospital cos they said he was allergic to something and they was putting him in a thing that only.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|a little box.
PS02G|Yeah same as.
PS02G|this.
PS6TB|and lumbered it.
PS02G|I know a little boy who had that.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS6TB|and all the way down his back.
PS02G|Yes.
PS6TB|you know and of course one or two did.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|come out you know one or two were leaves and you could see the shape of the leaves well that was just like me on my on my back.
PS02G|Funny in n it.
PS6TB|Funny yeah.
PS02G|It's years since I've dared have an orange yeah if I eat an orange I'd damn well.
PS6TB|Mm.
PS02G|get blisters over me wherever it touches try and eat one I'd have them on my tongue and in my mouth and everywhere.
PS02G|Just daren't touch them.
PS6TB|Well I'm the same I'm alright with you know that orange juice.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|Britvic orange juice I'm alright with that mind you I'll only only have one orange juice and lemonades I'm alright with that alright with an orange drink.
PS02G|Only look what I've er.
PS6TB|but.
PS02G|I probably could it depends if it's got real orange in cos when I went to work at Lockwoods at Lymestock.
PS6TB|Mm.
PS02G|we had some carbonated drinks factory I said well they they asked me if I'd go over there and I said I can't work in there I'm allergic to oranges and he said oh bloody or I've never seen an orange don't worry you know it's all chemicals Orange flavours that's about as much as what we'd ever get in here There's no blooming so I mean I could drink something like that which is purely chemical and never seen as li a damn orange That's all it is is flavourings and water and.
PS6TB|Mm.
PS02G|sugar and.
PS6TB|Yeah well that you see is just orange.
PS02G|But yeah but the pure orange I wouldn't dare to touch Cos they're some of them canned orange drinks are.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|are not orange they're all.
PS6TB|Yeah but I mean real oranges but you peel them and I'd.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|be bad that I'd come.
PS02G|that's it.
PS6TB|out in a rash.
PS02G|And if someone just squirted just.
PS6TB|but.
PS02G|squirted on that would be it.
PS6TB|you know those orange drinks which it says real oranges in nine times out of ten it isn't there's always some additives and what have you.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|because I used to have when I used to go around these for breakfast I'd always have an orange juice and my cereal and then my fried breakfast it's the only time I'd eat a fried breakfast.
PS02G|It's the only time Stuart does if they're away.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|He loves it but he wouldn't have one at home.
PS6TB|No.
PS02G|I've offered him I mean it's not as if.
PS6TB|Oh right.
PS02G|it's not there but he just won't.
PS6TB|Yeah I.
PS02G|he says no I can't it's a special and when you're on holiday it's different you can sit down and enjoy it.
PS6TB|Well when you're on holiday.
PS02G|and relax and.
PS6TB|Yes I mean when we we went on a.
PS02G|and er if you're going to work or something you don't er.
PS6TB|well we went on a course for a week up Newcastle and of course er erm we had to be there for nineo'clock so we had to catch the bus at the latest half past eight so you're up at you're up at seven and you get showered and what have you cos there's a shower in the be bedroom get yourself all ready so you're down by about erm half seven quarter to eight like so you tend to think quarter of an hour to the erm bus stop which is right outside the door of the hotel we were getting so and we use the bus rather than take the car in daily cos it's easier so I and er and of course I sat down and had a breakfast and I thoroughly enjo I didn't have any cereals you know I says well er and I had a little bit of orange orange juice but it was this erm made up orange juice.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|you know had some of that and erm my fried breakfast and my toast and my cup of coffee and I thoroughly enjoyed that set me up for the day that did.
PS02G|He does when they're on holidays.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|stay and have brea.
PS6TB|and then at lunchtime er first day we went out for lunch somewhere but erm.
PS02G|Didn't really want it.
PS6TB|not really want it a a couple of sandwiches or something to be going on.
PS02G|Yeah but.
PS6TB|erm but actually near the erm near the bridge the the large roundabout before you go over the Gateshead bridge erm underneath that there's a subway and what have you there's shops in there there's a little shop in there that th that used to do these rolls and beautiful rolls any bread you wanted any filling you wanted you know they have vast variety of different fillings you know and it was all there in these erm show cases and we used to go down there and get a sandwich take it back to to the place where we was you know this conference centre and erm it was great and then course when we got back.
PS6TB|we got back there was a a a meal there by the time we'd you know.
PS02G|Brought it in.
PS6TB|and what have you come down for a meal and we used to sit with the landlord having a having a natter whilst having a few few drinks and er yeah he he used to say er when we went up what do you fancy tonight Anything you fa you fancy No we'll leave it entirely up to you and i it wasn't English I think he was Polish or or you know and erm some beautiful meals there was a stew that he did and it was beautiful and we we told him.
PS02G|Oh yes.
PS6TB|we enjoyed that what was it And he I can't remember what it was now but he told us and erm a couple of days later he says erm when we went out he said what do you fancy tonight Don't mind bu wouldn't mind some of that sweet.
PS02G|Sweet ha ha ha ha.
PS6TB|couldn't get hold of that actually.
PS02G|Oh.
PS6TB|He went all over the place looking but he couldn't get hold of it I mean it was obviously it was something that he made himself but it was beautiful He was local to the area I think it was one of these bakers that used to used to do it but er he probably only used to do it once a week sell it once a week I think of all the people that was on course we got the best we got the best place and er and it came out that the erm tourist information booklet.
PS02G|Mm.
PS6TB|Yeah somebody had told us about a place to go to asking the bloody earth they were Yes I.
PS02G|Wh whe where we go in Yorkshire that Stu Stuart usually gets them out of the Cameron the the pub one where we go and stay and or they're dealing with you know what he's like with his deal he knows if it's there it's usually good fun so you know.
PS6TB|Yeah yeah Well he wasn't he used to be licensed.
PS02G|Oh.
PS6TB|but he let it lapse because.
PS02G|So.
PS6TB|he says I you try buying.
PS02G|I'd just as soon stay in a small pub.
PS6TB|Yeah well he used to find that a lo.
PS02G|rather than wholesale outlet.
PS6TB|a lot of the people used to come in and they'd be in in his hotel boozing rather than being at the pub you know he says it for me I got a bottle and everything there.
PS02G|Well like Black Bull at Boroughbridge you mean I mean I know it's a beautiful old pub the meals are absolutely wonderful.
PS6TB|Mm.
PS02G|But well it was only a pub.
PS6TB|Mm.
PS02G|I mean t to for the cooking that they did for a pub it was and we had duckling and salmon poached.
PS6TB|Mm.
PS02G|salmon and.
PS6TB|Mm.
PS02G|wonderful meals and she she was a real good.
PS6TB|Yeah well you see.
PS02G|good cook.

PS6TB|Yeah.
PS6TB|Yeah like we do we.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|An tha and that was about it but.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|I mean they were really lovely meals.
PS6TB|Yeah well you know I mean we could.
PS02G|look after you so well.
PS6TB|we could do it We could do do things like that.
PS02G|Mm.
PS6TB|if there was a call for it round here.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|That most people you know they won't try something like that I mean I know I'm a bit like that myself I'd sooner have a steak.
PS02G|No you see I'd I I'd.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|prefer to try.
PS6TB|but yeah and.
PS02G|if I'm going out for a meal I prefer to try something different you can have a steak at home I mean.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|so but I wouldn't go and get salmon.
PS6TB|I think the most most people get scampi.
PS02G|or duck yeah and say.
PS6TB|Most people have scampi.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|You know they they won't bother with something else.
PS02G|Me I'd rather try something different.
PS6TB|Yeah I mean erm.
PS02G|So wh why have so why go out for a meal and and eat something that you.
PS6TB|That you can have at home.
PS02G|you can have at home anyway and.
PS6TB|Well this is when I go when we go out.
PS02G|That's what I like about.
PS6TB|we always we always go to Spalding well not always but a lot of the time we go to Spalding and I always have what is called the raw vegetable dip it's all vegetables you name it the vegetables are on there you know carrots erm.
PS02G|Raw.
PS6TB|erm mushrooms cabbage and everything's raw completely raw carrots in th in the middle with two different two mayonnaise dips one plai s plain mayonnaise and the other half of it is erm garlic flavour mayonnaise and erm that's as a starter I always have that and I thoroughly enjoy it you know that's the by the time I've had that I don't want much of my main meal cos it's great.
PS02G|yeah.
PS6TB|plateful.
PS02G|I I rather have a.
PS6TB|I mean.
PS02G|starter or a.
PS6TB|but that is.
PS02G|or.
PS6TB|cos Michelle always has their erm prawn cocktail so there's like a prawn cocktail.
PS02G|I always have the main meal and the sweet Stu Stuart has a starter and the main meal.
PS6TB|But.
PS02G|Cos I I love the sweets see.
PS6TB|and then nor.
PS02G|then I ca.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|then I can't if I eat the starter then the main meal I do I can't eat the rest.
PS6TB|Yeah well I'm not ove I'm not over struck on some of their sweets that they do you know erm.
PS02G|I love the sweets.
PS6TB|the they don't do the same sweets week in week out I mean the they erm they vary them a on a possibly on a on an eight week basis so it all depends which week you go.
PS02G|Week you go.
PS6TB|as to which sweets is actually on that week and if it's one that you don't really fancy well I'm not bothered I'm not bothered about the sweets.
PS02G|No I on a weekly then you might have four or five dishes on it.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|and then the next week she'll have.
PS6TB|Mm.
PS02G|you know another lot.
PS6TB|Well if you.
PS02G|I mean she does everything you know burgers you know stuff that people want I mean that's bar meals but to sit in the dining.
PS6TB|Yeah.
PS02G|room you have.
PS6TB|Yeah well basically.
PS02G|proper meals.
PS6TB|ours basically what you wa what you what is set up there basic bar meals but i you can have it in the restaurant if you want.
PS02G|If you wish.
PS6TB|If you wish you know but I mean during the week nine times.
PS02G|So.
PS6TB|out of ten.
PS02G|so she did I think it was four se special meals then when we were there there was salmon duckling.
PS6TB|at the moment only on a Sunday we get the odd meals on a Sunday we get the odd meals on a Saturday night but nine times out of ten they only want to sit in there there's a.
PS02G|Sit in there.
PS6TB|they don't want to sit in the restaurant they very rarely do get them sitting in the restaurant I suppose to a certain extent other than the Sundays it's just waste of space.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|And it's not earning us anything in there but mind you erm it sometimes during the week where erm the tables are full of a load of papers and what have you where I've been doing paper work and that.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|sitting there doing paper work and the ki erm the kids use it as a a an office and what have you there with their paper work Sarah does her homework there and we have our meals in there so erm sort of it doesn't really matter but er you know it saves them all coming out for a meal and having to do it cos trouble is it's too small to keep an eye on people to see if they want anything everything's alright and what have you.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|but you want you don't want the door open because people can go there to the toilet.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|they look in.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|you know and you don't want that when you're eating a meal.
PS02G|When you're eating no.
PS6TB|So we shut the door.
PS02G|that's right I know.
PS6TB|and you're forever in and out in and out in and out of that it's alright say if we've got somebody in there that was in the.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|kitchen and just keeping their.
PS02G|right.
PS6TB|and we can't do that and be in here as well.
PS02G|No.
PS6TB|But er I I hope that I mean Shirley as she is she's not cooking but she will cook.
PS02G|She don't want to be.
PS6TB|I mean we both can cook if it comes to that I mean I can cook.
PS02G|Stuart's the one for a cook marvellous Stuart is should have been a chef he should smashing cook.
PS6TB|Well my mum often used to say that about me.
PS02G|Smashing cook he is.
PS6TB|And my brother.
PS02G|I'm not that bad but Stuart can beat me if he gets in the cooking mood.
PS6TB|Yeah I like to I like to have a go at different things I mean the the the other the other lunchtime we had you know he came in at lunchtime and er Shirley had gone somewhere Ann and er I'll have the chicken kiev for me please so so I went and did it did you cook that for him I says of course yes right he says I really enjoyed he says you know so I mean that made my day that did Daren't tell Shirl sh otherwise she'll say you'll do all the cooking.

PS02G|It's getting used to.
PS6TB|Well yes yes and Sarah will nip down as well and then Sarah was then getting used to doing she started getting used to doing it and that was it I used to come out and say well no I'll look after the bar from now on and that's it and er.

PS6TB|so I put her out in the end it erm it was surprising everybody knew what was going to happen they knew what I was going to do right when I come back in after swi place was empty they'd got out that door before I'd got her out the door but erm no it's it's very insulting.
PS02G|Yeah she should pay for it and all.
PS6TB|She'd got thing in her in her er yeah what's what it is up she damaged it ooh some years ago and it's been a bit weak since like you know but sh it was only a few weeks ago we got some computer big computer with big discs and she twisted her hand in in pulling one out you know it's I don't how the fell or something and she went to cash it or whatever and of course we're riding the motorbike for the like you have to change gear it's only a small seater your bike's open.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS6TB|to get up to the thirty five mile an hour you got ta go through all the five gears so you're forever pa going like that erm and that made it worse so that last fortnight she hasn't been on the bike and that last weekend when she went out she went because we was busy she got her bike out and she went up to work one or two of her mates and then come home she said she'd wished she hadn't of gone up.
PS02G|Oh dear.
PS6TB|because she was in pain again in had it strapped up again said come and see me in a week see if it's any better but erm she's injured it but not er you know it's obviously she can't move it a lot that way which is what's effecting her but mind you once she gets back on her bike again as it's cold weather.
PS02G|Yeah that won't help.
PS6TB|it'll be back again Mind you I feel it I mean I know at the moment it's it's me I my elbows in the morning I can't hardly move them when I wake up in the morning because I get that far my arms have to be outside the bed and our bedroom's that cold.
