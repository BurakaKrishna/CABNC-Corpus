PS02H|If I take penny there then that will all make forty pence okay You're not taking all that money are you You'll start getting back now now you're back to your last four pence when it comes down you start getting back don't you Oh what do I want here Oh I don't know whether I wanted that Bloody hell One two three on the bounce three six eight jack what's that supposed to be And a pair of tens jack queen king Feel alright Bloody man I don't want to see that it's got three on it.
PS02G|Oh boys on it.
PS02H|Well here are one two three on the bounce and I thought well you know that's a fairly good start jack queen king king high was a bit dodgy you never know do you.
PS02G|Oh I've got a handful of bloody pairs here wait a minute got fo I've only got three feels like a bloody handful of them Can't do nothing here Ain't got nothing there.
PS02H|Is that what you're playing.
PS02G|Well I have to I ain't got nothing else.
PS02H|Three fours eight nine ten queen high the pairs stuck at the end though dear.
PS02G|Oh not one flush.

PS02G|Yeah but then it split the bloody pairs all in bits.
PS02H|Yeah I know I know yes.
PS02G|Couldn't make a lot with that could I really.
PS02H|Not really no.
PS02G|there for three pairs which was just as well I stopped you on the last one.

PS02H|Wan na play one two three four five six and haven't you.
PS02G|Yes.
PS02H|Or five six seven and that's what you wan na do in n it.
PS02G|Oh yeah.
PS02H|No no I wouldn't do that I always do it like this if I was playing that hand three flu well you could go well you got a choice you can go take a chance on your last hand not getting through or you can go two three five six seven two three four ace finish them which is what I'd probably do.
PS02G|Oh I didn't see that oh.
PS02H|One more try.
PS02G|I didn't see that love.
PS02H|three queens jack flush ace high so I mean you wouldn't get any it anyway.
PS02G|I didn't see that last flush I couldn't ba I couldn't sort them out.
PS02H|Yeah but I mean it's it makes you one two three you wouldn't of had a one two three to start with.
PS02G|I know that.
PS02H|but you had a eight to finish with which is finishing and a one two three might not be and a better run so I think I would have been tempted to finish with the ace flush there try and stop me rather than trying to win it cos you had nothing else did you No you didn't have you didn't have a finishing hand you didn't really have a brilliant first two hands and then the pick of the one two three bouncer I might I might have been persuaded to play the one two three bouncer and hope that that got through but to finish with an ace flush but good.
PS02G|Oh I don't know I ain't got nothing.
PS02H|Neither have I.
PS02G|Oh I'm not playing this bugger it You chose I can't sort it out I ain't playing no more it's damn boring.
