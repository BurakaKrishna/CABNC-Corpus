PS02G|And if we make an appointment to view some places and then we'll know what time we've got to doing the shopping and fit it in round taking mum Seeing mum.
PS02H|something erm next week.
PS02G|So you don't fancy this afternoon.
PS02H|In the morning Oh yeah well yeah I mean if if they if.
PS02G|Cos as I say if we did see Sefton Avenue or New Drove today.
PS02H|If there's nothing available That's what I meant.
PS02G|Oh yeah there's plenty of time I don't really want to go on a Saturday Saturday afternoons with mum.
PS02H|Saturday afternoons with Helen.
PS02G|well I wouldn't be absolutely if if I had to go out then I'd have to go out Then there's always Saturday morning see Helen but then Stuart likes to sleep in But no I think Saturday's out really It's not a day for viewing houses We could go out Sunday And mum could come as well.
PS02H|I don't know whether they work.
PS02G|Oh yes People at work all the week don't they.
PS02H|Yes.
PS02G|Gets dark in the evenings then then then definitely That's the only time you can view a property I mean unless somebody's living in it you can't go in the evenings in the winter can you And I don't fancy a house that somebody's actually living in Cos then you've got ta wait while they.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|And it can all fall through because theirs is falling through or they can't get out when you want and that can go on for Can it not.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Sometimes it just can't be helped cos there's nothing in your price range you know that you like that isn't empty but I would prefer an empty property so that when we decide and then whatever just.
PS02G|Certainly if we'd see something that would do this afternoon or New Drove today that's fine.
PS02H|No problem.
PS02G|Two of them at New Drove are downstairs and one is an upstairs The one upstairs because it hasn't got a bay window.
PS02H|Yes.
PS02G|is larger The upstairs one is slightly larger.
PS02H|The upstairs one's larger.
PS02G|number seven which is an upstairs one hasn't got any bay windows It is larger than the two five and six that are downstairs.
PS02H|Who's selling that one.
PS02G|Well one's Cornerstone One's Cornerstone.
PS02H|So one's Cornerstone and two are the other.
PS02G|Two are Hansard.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|I think it's Cornerstone one that's the larger of the two the three Six seven Hansard.
PS02H|Hansard.
PS02G|They're doing five and seven so they've got one above each other.
PS02H|So they've got one one's doing two and one's doing one.
PS02G|One's doing five and seven which is this is for two and one's doing six which is this one.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Seven is definitely slightly bigger than six and five I checked it out The lounge is fourteen by ten The bedroom is thirteen nine by nine instead of eleven by eight That kitchen's thirteen by five that totals eleven by seven.
PS02H|Neither here nor there is it.
PS02G|No None of it's much difference It's only a diff er it's a matter of two feet here and.
PS02H|Yes.
PS02G|But then I don't mind I don't mind living upstairs or on the ground Well I mean if they've got the key to both might haven't decided on both of them you might as well go and see them.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Both of them See which one you like the best or if you like them at all But as it's got that financial package.
PS02H|That's Cornerstone.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|Don't know whether the same applies to the other two.
PS02G|it The financial package.
PS02H|With Cornerstone.
PS02G|Cornerstone.
PS02H|Doesn't actually say that in Pantiles.
PS02G|No.
PS02H|Oh Just have to ask.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02G|But actually the one at Cornerstone is fifty pound cheaper than the both of them at Hansard.
PS02G|It is.
PS02H|Fifty pound.
PS02G|One's nine nine fifty and one's nine nine.
PS02H|five yeah.
PS02G|So it's forty five pound different.
PS02H|Well that's a good way if you think about it he's got he's got four flats there hasn't he.
PS02G|Oh yeah.
PS02H|Four flats at thirty thousand That's a hundred and twenty thousand for two houses They could be sixty thousand apiece.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|Whereas if he had if he sold them as separate houses he'd probably get forty thousand apiece.
PS02G|Yeah that's just Yeah.
PS02H|Forty five thousand even apiece.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|But he's making the money by selling them as flats.
PS02G|Yeah The only difference is he's had a few thousand extra because it's got two kitchens and two bathrooms partitions and.
PS02H|Yeah true he's had that yeah extra fittings.
PS02G|But apart from that oh an extra bath instead of the other bedroom.
PS02H|Yeah Yeah.
PS02G|and erm another kitchen instead of a dining room or something and that's the only difference Say three four thousand probably For the extra bits and pieces that's all.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|I don't know how many of them there are Whether they only had four flats or whether there's a flat on another block and another block of fours down the road I mean I don't know.
PS02H|Only assume there's you've got that one block.
PS02G|Well there might be four blocks of four or I du n no.
PS02H|No I don't think so Not enough space for them.
PS02G|No I don't know I mean you know the area better than me.
PS02H|Unless they've knocked them garages down or something.
PS02G|I've no idea I know them council houses aren't usually but I mean I can't visualize how much land there is I only know that by going to school and.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|where they are.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Probably should have gone the other way into town but.
PS02H|that.
PS02G|Eh.
PS02H|Neither here nor there.
PS02G|Well you could have gone sort of like round the Rainbow and that way on That's what I meant.
PS02G|the bypass that end of town would have been perhaps a little bit clearer.
PS02H|If you look at the first it might help you to decide whether you like.
PS02G|That's it Whether you wan na go and see it.
PS02H|Whether you wan na go and see them or not Whether you like the positions.
PS02G|I mean we know where Sefton Avenue is and we know that's.
PS02H|Well we know where it is.
PS02G|a nice house.
PS02H|Well we don't know really We haven't seen it have we.
PS02G|Well I mean I mean.
PS02H|Yeah but we haven't actually looked ins.
PS02G|No but I mean I know which house it is with that one and you do don't you.
PS02H|I think so yes.
PS02G|Well I think so as well.
PS02H|But it would be nice just to go and have a quick check.
PS02G|Oh I think just to make sure that.
PS02H|Just to make sure I like it Or.
PS02G|it is the house that we're thinking about We think it is.
PS02H|You may not like it.
