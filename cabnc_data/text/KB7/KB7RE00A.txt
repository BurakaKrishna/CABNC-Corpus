PS02H|See you tomorrow.
PS02H|There we go Is that better dear.
PS02G|Yeah That's lovely.
PS02H|Shall we have a nice cup of tea.
PS02G|I was gasping Especially when that man was.
PS02H|Rabbitting.
PS02G|Yeah which I didn't understand any of it.
PS02H|No.
PS02G|Pension mortgages and this mortgage and and he didn't really know how er er cos that that foreign Lucy or whatever her name was.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|that foreign lady was quite amused She was laughing when you were asking him questions.
PS02H|Oh.
PS02G|as if to say ah ah he's not sure what he's doing He's got somebody here who knows.
PS02G|Instead of just sitting there and quoting all these figures.
PS02H|yeah.
PS02G|and blinding you with science.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Somebody who can ask questions and knew what he was talking about.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|And she was giggling away She kept raising her eyebrows and laughing I was watching her.
PS02H|Well I couldn't see her cos I had my back turned.
PS02G|No you had your back to her.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|But I could see behind you and she was.
PS02H|Well there you are When you do know a bit about it you yes you want to know.
PS02G|Well that's it You're not and you're not gon na be blinded by all these like he was what was he saying about all endowments are are not unit then you were saying yes they are and.
PS02H|I didn't know what on about there I I think he got his.
PS02G|said that.
PS02H|Oh he knew what he was talking about but.
PS02G|But you were confusing him because you knew where he's used to just sitting there and telling blah blah blah blah and.
PS02H|Well you see the thing is they they they.
PS02G|And you knew what he was on about.
PS02H|they quote this unit linked business Now it's all.
PS02G|And you didn't want that did you.
PS02H|well and good a unit linked policy but as I said to you before that if they if the market crashes the day before your policy is due out you.
PS02G|And you haven't got enough money.
PS02H|you could you can lose a th I don't want one.
PS02H|If the market crashes the day before you take your policy's due to mature wallop You can lose a lot of money in a you know just like that.
PS02G|But do you think this thing what he was on about pension mortgage do you think that would be better Was that that pep thing what's all in the papers at the moment.
PS02H|No.
PS02G|Is that what it means.
PS02H|pep's different.
PS02G|Oh Is it similar.
PS02H|pep's a personal equity plan.
PS02G|Oh Sorry.
PS02H|Which is different To be perfectly honest in my current situation.
PS02G|Mhm.
PS02H|a pension mortgage would be more advantageous.
PS02G|Well that's the most important thing isn't it.
PS02H|At the moment Because well I'm not in a pension scheme at work But I have got an option to go in it.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|if I want to.
PS02G|Mhm.
PS02H|Erm the only problem is well even s even not so much now because because the er a bit better Because of the m because of the way pensions and that are are organized now they're more flexible now I mean you can go to a job beforehand if if if your company had a pension scheme you were obliged to go in it that was it All your other arrangements went up went through the window.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|Erm so it it it it's difficult.
PS02G|Mm I know you can take them along with you nowadays can't you and into a.
PS02H|You can now take now now now you can take them with you.
PS02G|Mm Where they used to be frozen and then you started another one wherever you went next time.
PS02H|That's right That's right Whereas now.
PS02G|And you ended up with three four d silly little bits and pieces didn't you.
PS02H|Yeah Yeah Whereas now you see all the they can put them all into one.
PS02G|Yeah I know you can take them with you now.
PS02H|Mm So in a way I think.
PS02G|And it was a lot less money as well wasn't it.
PS02H|I mm yeah but that w don't forget.
PS02G|It started.
PS02H|that was sixty five.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|The quotation he give was sixty five and as he said which is true they double every five years Particularly in the later years there's you know.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|more And that's why I said when it sounded so low that's why I I still doubt his figures I still think two hundred pound a month a thirty thousand pound mortgage it's too low.
PS02G|And and a cash sum at the end of it.
PS02H|Still think it's low.
PS02G|Seems quite doesn't seem a lot does it.
PS02H|No I'm pretty certain.
PS02G|And would you still have to have an insurance on top of that.
PS02H|You have to have term assurance.
PS02G|So you'd still have to have.
PS02H|You'd have.
PS02G|you'd have the two hundred pound and then you'd have a life insurance on top.
PS02H|No no no No That was it two hundred and twelve pound.
PS02G|The whole lot.
PS02H|The whole lot.
PS02G|Well why doesn't everybody have them then.
PS02H|Because not everybody's eligible for them.
PS02G|I know but they didn't he didn't suggest it to you or why doesn't he say well there is this er er you said that he didn't And he must have known that they're gon na be cheaper so why doesn't he advise people who are starting out to take one of them.
PS02H|Didn't ask.
PS02G|Rather than a.
PS02H|Didn't ask the questions.
PS02G|I know exactly But surely that's.
PS02H|He didn't he.
PS02G|his job If he's trying to find you the cheapest.
PS02H|He's not doing his job Basically.
PS02G|Exactly.
PS02H|he's not doing his job.
PS02G|Because a young couple going in well even in our situation you haven't got much money and you want the cheapest thing for the best we you know But he never suggested it You said what about a company what about a a pension mortgage and he.
PS02H|He didn't he he didn't ask the question Which he should have asked.
PS02G|Mm Exactly Yeah because it is cheaper and.
PS02H|You see the thing is you see I mean wh wh when this law came out lautro and all that business came out that and best advice and all this sort of thing you had to go through all the finances and what people earned and all that sort of thing What they've got insurance already erm so on and so forth And arrange around those circumstances the best advice package.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|But he didn't ask me the questions He just he just he just.
PS02G|No he just could do an endowment one and that was it.
PS02H|he just assumed it was gon na be.
PS02G|An an endowment policy and endowment mortgage and that was it He didn't tell you anything else.
PS02H|No Well you see when he said your base is gon na be.
PS02G|I know.
PS02H|a hundred and two hundred.
PS02G|Ninety six.
PS02H|and fifteen pounds or whatever.
PS02G|Two hundred and five and then that on a ninety six.
PS02H|And then a percent I could get you a percent off as a first time buyer.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|That brings it down to a hundred and ninety six for the first year Then it goes back up to the base rate.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|Not I know all that's that's obvious.
PS02G|That's quite clear Mm.
PS02H|But then when he said two hundred and one pounds for a pension mortgage I thought well if a hundred and ninety.
PS02G|That's only five pound a month to earn your pension.
PS02H|if a hu if a hundred and ninety six is only your base how come you don't.
PS02G|That gives you five pound a month towards your pension which is nothing is it.
PS02H|how do you get two how do you get two hundred and one pounds or two hundred and fifteen pounds and what with because of the term assurance on top That's fourteen pounds a month term assurance Quite high I think.
PS02G|What's term assurance Don't understand that.
PS02H|Term assurance is life insurance just on life only With no cash sum at the end.
PS02G|Well if you died you'd be dead Well that's fair enough isn't it You wouldn't want anything else.
PS02H|But er throughout throughout the term of my life.
PS02G|And if you died the would be paid.
PS02H|If I died a lump sum of thirty thousand pounds is payable.
PS02G|That's it you'd pay.
PS02H|But I think fourteen pounds a month is quite high Term assurance I'm tempted I'm I'm I'm tempted to have a word with Mick.
PS02G|What and arrange your own.
PS02H|Well.
PS02G|Or he'd just tell you.
PS02H|well I whether I I don't know whether he would or whether he wouldn't I mean he might he might not but then again he might He might if I if I talk to him he might tell me what sort of I don't want to hassle him you see cos I've hassled.
PS02G|No that's it.
PS02H|him before Not on that sort of thing but other things as well sort of thing and I don't wan na I'd like to know.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|I'd like to know before you know.
PS02G|You've got to get the right deal.
PS02H|Yeah I I did two hundred and one pound a month or two hundred and fift okay it sounds cheap but I don't know fourteen pound a month just for li thirty thousand pound life cover over suppose it's the.
PS02G|Yeah but that's not that much a we.
PS02H|I suppose it's the term of years.
PS02G|It's only three quid a m a week.
PS02H|Yeah but I suppose it's the term of years as well You sort of to sixty five rather than at sixty.
PS02G|Well that's it.
PS02H|So that probably makes it but I say without having me own book to check it I can't.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|I can't tell you You see you can you get a lot you can get tax relief off that or you used to be able to get tax relief.
PS02G|Well he said you could get tax relief on the whole lot.
PS02H|On the whole lot yeah.
PS02G|That's what he said At twenty five percent.
PS02H|At twenty five percent I think you still I'm not sure whether they've changed the law round or not cos they.
PS02G|Well that's what he said didn't he.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Er you'd be handy for a a tax relief on the whole lot rather than just.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|part of it.
PS02H|Cos that you see if you if you if you could link up life assurance to your pension you could get tax relief on your life assurance you see.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|Which makes it advantageous because there's no tax relief on life policies now as there was.
PS02H|There used to be yeah.
PS02G|There used to be but there is no.
PS02G|But they stopped it.
PS02H|there is they stopped it There isn't any more.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|No I'm sort of I think he confused himself as well as confusing me slightly.
PS02G|Yeah be because you you confused him.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Because you knew.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|Rather than somebody as I say like me who sat down there and he'd just quote all these figures and you wouldn't know what the hell he was on about and just all you all I would understand at the end is that's what you got ta pay.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|Which is what most people that go in there.
PS02H|Are interested in.
PS02G|Well they wouldn't understand all the rest This plan that plan the other plan They only know well you either have this option paying this amount that option paying that amount or that option paying that amount and which one do you want to have.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|And and you don't understand any of the rest of it.
PS02H|No No.
PS02G|You just sit there mm yeah mm no mm well that's the cheapest that's the dearest and and take their advice which ones the best for you and have it And that's er that's all normal people who don't understand any of it that's the way they'd go about it isn't it.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|You'd just accept whatever was.
PS02H|See the other thing I don't know well no I'm not sure you can now See if I took a pension mortgage out it would be linked to me lumped into me current pension contract Cos I've already got a pension scheme running Cos I've contracted out of serps And also got erm erm what used to be called seventy seven.
PS02G|Yes Stuart.
PS02H|Erm a frozen pension with the Pru.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|linked in with it at the moment That's that's that's my pension arrangements at the moment.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|Mm so I'm tempted er if I'm gon na do a pension.
PS02G|I tell you what you wa who you wan na go and see Who I saw when I bought the house at er thing Now he was I know he blinded me with science but he wa he was really very good and he had his computer there and he went through all these different societies and plans.
PS02H|Well that's what he's done You see that's what he's done.
PS02G|No but he had I mean he had a screen and er.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|and that was that's along near Maxie's near the post office but it's a.
PS02G|Yeah I saw him.
PS02H|Oh the erm the Scots chap Er what's his name.
PS02G|Oh and he was smashing And he explained it all to me.
PS02H|Oh I can't think of his name now I I I have had dealings with him.
PS02G|He he explained it all.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|And although there was all these figures and er and he explained what was best I mean he was purely a financial I mean he he as he said when we went in cos it doesn't make no difference I I I'm not attached to anything I'm here to.
PS02H|No But nor's he.
PS02G|I am here to give you advice.
PS02H|That's it.
PS02G|And that's it.
PS02H|Independent financial advice.
PS02G|And and therefore I'm not here to sell you this or that I'm here purely to find out you want to buy this council house and and and I'm here purely to find out your circumstances and and what would be the best deal for you.
PS02H|That's right.
PS02G|And he went I mean I was there for blooming ages And he went through everything till he found out and it wa I didn't have the abs the absolute cheapest one Cos he didn't think that was a because Steven was disabled and that as well and on my money and one thing and another.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|and and one thing and another but er it I mean mi mine ended up with the Bradford and Bingley I mean.
PS02H|Yeah well they're agents for Bradley Bradford and Bingley.
PS02G|Yeah I know but he did say that even though agents I'm not giving you this and then he showed me all the things you know to sort of prove that he was doing it But that's wh oh yeah that's who I had.
PS02H|Yeah It doesn't matter what building society you go to.
PS02G|No well that's what he said it doesn't but I mean he went through all these and insurance companies and because of my kidney being removed I had to pay I had to pay higher even though I didn't have to have a bloody medical but I had to pay high because of my.
PS02H|Yeah Medical condition.
PS02G|because I'd had medical Yeah it was cos I'd had all these operations You know you had to put how many operations have you had in the last ten years and have are you er receiving any treatment and all that bloody blah blah blah.
PS02G|And so mine mine was higher.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|than er than other peoples which is why he went to all these bloody quotes.
PS02H|See the thing yeah As I say the thing the thing is as I say it's you you your mor.
PS02G|He sorted it all out But he was really good.
PS02H|Yeah Your mortgage it doesn't matter who your mortgage is with basically I mean you can go to most places and.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|you're gon na be paying.
PS02G|But when you buy a council house it is slightly different in as much as some some of them won't have them.
PS02H|Oh yeah yeah yeah.
PS02G|Then also he also gave me I mean I got hundred percent mortgage which you are allowed on I mean the law says er t the chance to buy so therefore you don't have to have a deposit But he also gave me enough to cover all my fees legal fees.
PS02H|Yeah Yeah.
PS02G|So I borrowed over what the house was worth But that was only because I'd lived in it for a long time and I got a discount so the house was really.
PS02H|Discount Yeah.
PS02G|worth more.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|than what I was paying for it.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Cos I got a discount so er I borrowed another thousand pound.
PS02H|To cover your costs.
PS02G|to cover all the costs for the survey for Maxie's and and this that and the other Which I think come to about eight nine hundred pound.
PS02H|Mm As I say it doesn't matter what building.
PS02G|Anyway he borrowed all that for me.
PS02H|it doesn't matter what building society you go to you're gon na be paying basically the same rate Because they're all the same rate The base rate's the same You okay one place you can get a percent discount you might get a percent and a half discount depending on your.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|depending on the building society at the time It's the life policy.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|that makes the difference.
PS02G|But to go to somebody like him who knew his job.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|which was his job and and had everything there and he he patched through to this computer this place and different computers that he had.
PS02H|Yeah Yeah.
PS02G|And the facility to to get through to.
PS02H|Mm Mm.
PS02G|That he could get all these to find out what he thought was the best policy in in your.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|as I say because of my health and one thing and another you couldn't just and he and he was really good he was and explained everything to me I say that.
PS02H|Can't think of his name now but I know the chap He was a tall chap with glasses.
PS02G|Mm Yeah Yeah Ever so nice.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|He really you know made me feel I say I weren't sat there like I was with that fella thinking well he don't seem to know what he's saying anyway.
PS02H|No no.
PS02G|Which is what the impression I got about him he wasn't really sure himself.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|But I think that was partly you floored him because you knew.
PS02H|Yeah Yeah.
PS02G|He sort of was a bit you got him a bit couldn't say But certainly that man that I went to that time he was very very nice and.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|then you could see he'd patch into all these different bloody things and.
PS02H|Mm mm.
PS02G|and and and I ended up with er a reasonable.
PS02H|Was yours an endowment Or just.
PS02G|It was an endowment Yeah it had to be I du n no why but it had to be.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|Well I don't know but that's what.
PS02H|When does your mortgage finish then.
PS02G|My mortgage I had it in eighty one twenty years so another ten years.
PS02H|So in fact there's still an endowment policy on you to cover that mortgage.
PS02G|No they were all cancelled weren't it.
PS02H|I du n no.
PS02G|Oh yeah I signed the form.
PS02H|So your endowment policy.
PS02G|Everything's all.
PS02H|Ended.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|Cancelled.
PS02G|Cancelled Stopped.
PS02H|Well what about the money.
PS02G|The money was all I don't know I just signed forms to say that I was no longer responsible or had any claim on the property or whatever And that was it I didn't have to pay any more and I didn't and I was passing it over to to Steve I don't know what happened.
PS02H|Yeah but what about the The life policy was in your name.
PS02G|The whole lot was in was it endowment No I du n no it can't have been can it I don't know No it wasn't it was a no it wasn't an endowment I didn't pay I only paid extra insurance.
PS02H|Oh just a straight term p policy like I was.
PS02G|Yeah because yeah because because of my health.
PS02H|Yeah.
PS02G|Yeah That was it Yeah it was Yeah Because of my health.
PS02H|It was a term assurance rather than it being an endowment insurance Yeah.
PS02G|I couldn't I don't think he could get the other he got that one because of i in my health you couldn't they couldn't say how long.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|because of my kidney The other kidney could go all blah blah blah and this that and the other Yeah It was just ordinary insurance I don't know how much it was I don't know I mean I only paid a hundred and sixty pound a month but I mean.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|Then I only borrowed twenty odd thousand cos I got a forty odd percent discount off the price of the house anyway.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|Twenty two I think it was something like that.
PS02H|Mm You see.
PS02G|And the rent was thirty six pound a week And it ended up I was buying it for less money than what I was paying monthly for rent.
PS02H|Yeah Well you would do.
PS02G|So it was all.
PS02H|It was worth it.
PS02G|Might as well have done it.
PS02H|Mm Mm.
PS02G|So I went into it.
PS02H|Mm Mm.
PS02G|Yeah it it worked out hundred and sixty one pound a month with the insurance So it's alright I mean I paid the whole bloody lot to them I didn't.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|sort it all out You don't pay it separate I didn't I paid to council offices.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|And they sorted they forward it I suppose or did whatever they had to do with it.
PS02H|Mm mm.
PS02G|Used to pay at the council offices different book used to go and pay it Write the cheque out and he'd just take it in.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|I could have had it done through the bank but he was always up town anyway so.
PS02H|Mm So it didn't make any difference.
PS02G|didn't make any difference one way or the other.
PS02H|Mm Mm.
PS02H|So how about you You'd have it done through the bank anyway and I'd just pay you weekly I cou might as well rather than monthly.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|Save you going to the bank Couldn't I Just give you the money you spends.
PS02H|We'll see when we come when it comes down to it won't we What we could do financially And sort something out then.
PS02G|Well of course we will expect you to pay.
PS02H|But I cert I I I I I ju I it it just sounds you know two hundred pounds a month just over two hundred pound a month.
PS02G|Sounds smashing dun n it.
PS02H|Sounds wonderful.
PS02G|That's what I said why doesn't everybody have them.
PS02H|Well that's why I can't believe it.
PS02G|Well he said go back and tomorrow at least and.
PS02H|And check his figures.
PS02G|Mhm If that's right that's the one you want really isn't it.
PS02H|Well I I I yeah I mean obviously I'd have to pay more er for if I want it to end at sixty.
PS02G|Mm But even then it won't be will it be that much.
PS02H|To get to get a higher lump sum To get a higher lump sum But then you see.
PS02G|Would it be that much more.
PS02H|Shouldn't think so.
PS02G|Well exactly So it's gon na.
PS02H|You see it's.
PS02G|be less than a want two hundred and eighty.
PS02H|Oh yeah.
PS02G|I said so you might as well have that and have a lump sum and a blooming house and.
PS02H|And a pension.
PS02G|And a pension That's what I mean Might as well have your pension when you get to sixty.
PS02H|Mm Say it's only twenty six years and course with a pension see you can increase your contributions.
PS02G|Yeah If if you get a better job and what have you you can always.
PS02H|Better job or whatever or pay rise or whatever you can increase.
PS02G|Yeah you.
PS02H|your contributions into your pension plan.
PS02G|Exactly yes.
PS02H|and still and finish your mortgage earlier.
PS02G|Yeah.
PS02H|Fifty five.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|Or fifty Depending on how much you wan na pay.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|If you wan na pay more into it But I still think.
PS02G|Well see what he comes up with.
PS02H|See what he comes up with yeah See what he comes up with.
PS02G|And certainly say two hundred and twenty five pound a month it's still worth having.
PS02H|It's cheaper than we're paying now isn't it.
PS02G|Mm Even if it's two hundred and fifty it the same.
PS02H|Well you'd still.
PS02G|you're gon na have a pension and and a home.
PS02H|In a way I'd rather pay the same and finish the mortgage earlier.
PS02G|Yeah well that's it You could volunteer to pay two hundred and fifty a month couldn't you.
PS02H|And pay a higher pension policy.
PS02G|Mhm That's what I mean.
PS02H|And then and then you've got the option then you've got the further option that if you want to reduce your premiums on your pension you can do.
PS02G|If anything happened Mm.
PS02H|If anything if if it does You see again and then you see if you're out of a job you see you if you happen to be out of a job then you're not eligible for a pension policy.
PS02G|What happens then then If you get made redundant.
PS02H|Well.
PS02G|And you've already got it.
PS02H|Well then you have to freeze it See that's that's the oth that's another drawback with the pension Whereas an endowment policy it doesn't matter You you can carry on paying an endowment policy So it you know there's pros and cons either way.
PS02G|Mm.
PS02H|There's there's er pros and cons in buying either of tho either of the flats You see er that's the thing isn't it.
PS02G|Mhm But you've got to make the decision cos I like both of them very much.
