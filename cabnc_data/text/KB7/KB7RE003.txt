PS02H|Bad as that.
PS02G|Oh He was a calling her effing this swearing oh it was dreadful She was screaming and you could hear her crying Then you hear she pounded up the bloody stairs and he was after her and I reckon well the only room with a lock.
PS02H|As you say is the bathroom.
PS02G|is the bathroom so she must have been in there cos he's hammering on the door and bashing it and kicking it Bloody hell of a row Or whether she opened it or whether she was in the front bedroom with something behind the door I du n no but.
