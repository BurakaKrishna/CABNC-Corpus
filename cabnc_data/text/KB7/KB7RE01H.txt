PS02H|Oh yes pleasant oh yes pleasant.
PS02G|I've never liked anything else he's had particularly have you But I just find that pleasant listening.
PS02H|Oh it's a pleasant sound.
PS02G|Pleasant and nice songs I suppose I don't know it's just quite like it it's now big it's about the most thing he's ever recorded that I have liked.
PS02H|Mm.
PS02G|I've absolutely never been a Jason Donovan fan before Christmas number one's going to be Bohemian Rhapsody which I do like you know.
PS02H|I know will do.
PS02G|yes it's already going to the top of the charts to be number one for Christmas all the other Christmas songs are.
PS02H|They're all coming down and that one's er.
PS02G|yep.
PS02H|going up.
PS02G|that will do.
PS02H|They always prices keep falling.
PS02G|Well I understand its reasoning but I think if you've been very hard pushed list with this money don't you.
PS02H|Mm mm.
PS02G|Considering I'm not supposed to have that cos I had it when Ann and bought it not sure if it's now are you.
PS02H|Not really was though I thought we were offering a reasonable price taking everything into consideration.
PS02G|upstairs and.
PS02H|price market.
PS02G|market.
PS02H|erm how long we've been here sitting tenants er.
PS02G|I'm not thinking it object the sitting tenants.
PS02H|the I thought that was fair.
PS02G|as it stands at the moment.
PS02H|fairly good deal.
PS02G|Mm See here they're gon na get thirty six for it as it stands put it on the market as.
PS02H|Might do yeah.
PS02G|Might even two years.
PS02H|When you look at look at the old houses on the market erm yeah I think he might just he might wait a while there aren't that many buyers.
PS02G|Oh that's it that's why they're coming down that's why are quite pleased to see us dear especially at this time of the year not many people will buy Christmas time think oh we'll wait and go and get Christmas over and the spring and.
PS02H|I think looking at the market you can you can get a erm detached semi-detached sort of one you know one bedroom I suppose.
PS02G|You can get two bedroom.
PS02H|two bedroom at a push for about thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven.
PS02H|oh I don't know I don't know I think it will be a while getting rid of it yes but I think he might get his price eventually but it will take a long while to get it it's up to him if he wants a quick sale you know thirty five yeah I thirty five thousand I think as I say taking everything into consideration I mean failing three okay I know I did the thirty three so take thirty five thirty three and a half oh he ain't got much to worry about.
PS02G|Well.
PS02G|I'd better get some clothies on cause a bit of a stir round the estate agents naked from the waist down darling.
PS02G|What that's ten minutes slow Just a-f-bout done all your paper work on them teams.
PS02H|I know.
PS02G|got a he's coming tomorrow you know got the bird as well ain't we that's why I got up early to I go through deeply objective.
PS02H|Why what's been.
PS02G|it's completely anonymous number you know it's only to be on that said I'll wipe it off then you bloody well won't I think he wants to tell people before he can say very wrong could say something personal if it was personal no longer it no you weren't personal to you but I'm quite happy to arrange it if you wish no no no no no I shouldn't have to tell you not to take my points in full there we go it's driving me doing that in the factory having without people's permission I want to know I ask permission if I'd er wanted to as a without being asked to do it I would of gone and seen personnel and asked I would not of dreamed of doing it in a work's situation unless I was asked say anything personal I'd turned it off not that it apart from me and Stuart.
PS02H|Go on.
PS02G|apart from me and Stuart there's nothing personal on it really we went me and er telling me about her problems I only put that on a tape do you.
PS02H|its not er.
PS02G|you know anything personal like that you turn it off don't you not that they know or care whi anyone's personal problems anyway they don't know who we are.
