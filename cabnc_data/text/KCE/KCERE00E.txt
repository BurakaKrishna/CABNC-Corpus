PS0EG|Yeah.
PS0EB|If you can have it c if you can have it cut all one length it's alright then.

PS0EG|You you can't wash your hair for about er when you have extensions.
PS0EC|I don't like men having long hair.
PS0EG|you can't wash your hair for about two months or something like that.
PS0EC|Don't suit them.

PS0EG|Here you are And this is a good one diskette fire you computer you need a disk some scissors white or blue kitchen matches so and clear nail polish The reason they've got ta be those colours is erm and clear nail polish Carefully open up the diskette three point five inches for the best effect and it's like my Amiga one remove the top covering from the inside scrape a lot of match powder into a bowl match powder After you have a lot spread it evenly on the inside disk Using nail polish spread it over the match mixture let it dry carefully put diskette back together nail polish to seal it do it on the inside where it came apart When that disk is in a drive the drive head to read the disk which causes a small fire inside disk drive ha ha ha ha let the fuckhead try and fix that It melts all your disk drive Start all start a fire Excellent eh bomb this is good.
PS0EF|Well on mine she did it once it didn't work so she did it again for free and then it all started breaking off It fell out the day after.
PS0EC|It's probably your hair then.
