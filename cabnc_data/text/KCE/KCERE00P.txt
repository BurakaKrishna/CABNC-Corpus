PS0EB|and er and yeah she said but your father liked it did he And I goes no he hated it he used to get detention every day for not wearing his cap he hated it and he didn't do any work Cos she was expecting me to trot out something like yes both my parents went to grammar school like everybody else whose parents went you know they were all saying yes my parents went to grammar school and they got these and these have got these qualifications and everything I couldn't believe it though there's a load of people in our class and like you know all the parents are all these things and they're not exactly brilliant the children.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|you know like Olivia er both her parents are teachers and all this business.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|er you know she's not.
PS0ED|they don't have any time.
PS0EB|she's not much to shout about you know intelligence-wise.
PS0ED|Who was that with Miss.
PS0EB|mum had failed but she said why I goes well all the all the questions were matters science and she weren't any good at that.
PS0EB|Would would would erm grandma and granddad let you go anyway Would they of let you go if you'd passed.
PS0ED|Oh yeah course they would of done.
PS0EB|Well some p parents didn't like it did they Didn't want their children to go to it.
PS0ED|No well it was a fixed system anyway.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|if you were well to do you you went I mean the the grammar schools in the grammar school like your dad went to I mean it was it was a really you know it was a grammar school it wasn't anything like it is now.
PS0EB|Well there was two grammar schools in Lincoln though weren't there.
PS0ED|Well there was the City school and the Lincoln school.
PS0EB|The Lincoln school.
PS0ED|The Lincoln school was is by the hospital.
PS0EB|weren't weren't there a girls.
PS0ED|There was the the the Chri Christ Hospital which was the girls high school.
PS0EB|Weren't there weren't there another boys and girls one or whatever or were there just the boys.
PS0ED|No there was just.
PS0EB|and the girls.
PS0ED|no there was one girls school which was Christ Hospital.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|which was up Lindon Hill.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0ED|and there was the City school which was on Monk's Road and there was the Lincoln school which was on Brambury Road which is.
PS0EB|Where was.
PS0ED|now Christ Hospital.
PS0EB|Yeah where was Christ Hospital then.
PS0ED|Christ Hospital was on Lindon Hill.
PS0EB|Where.
PS0ED|Christ Hospital was.
PS0EB|Where the old where the college is now that art college.
PS0ED|Yeah you know half way up Lindon Hill there's three stone steps.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|and you went up there and there's them building sort of on the top isn't there.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|that piece and so you start go up this building across and it's like it's it's the school there.
PS0EB|Right.
PS0ED|and that's Christ Hospital or was.
PS0EB|Or was.
PS0ED|and that was the girls grammar school and then there was the City school where your dad went and there was the Lincoln school.
PS0EB|Was that co-ed.
PS0ED|that come out at Bram Brambury Road what.
PS0EB|Was it boys and girls.
PS0ED|No no there was the girls school and there was the two boys school.
PS0EB|That's a bit unfair.
PS0ED|There wasn't another grammar there wasn't another girls grammar school oh what was Spring Hill Oh great I don't know Spring Hill was something.
PS0EB|Girls.
PS0ED|Yeah it was a yeah Spring Hill was a grammar school it was a girls grammar school.
PS0EB|Oh.
PS0ED|Yeah because erm poor thingy the girl I went to school with she went on to Spring Hill when she was fifteen see you could go on to grammar school when you were fifteen then as well as going at eleven.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|if you passed if you failed the eleven plus and if you were clever enough you could take an exam like an entry exam to go it's sort of if you improve from eleven to fifteen you could take an entry exam to go into grammar school then so that you could take your G CE's.
PS0EB|Like erm but like Miss says some of the stuff on it was so rubbish I mean like there was somebody she knew who their son failed the eleven plus twice and now they've got their P H D.
PS0ED|Yeah mm.
PS0EB|they failed but they failed their eleven plus twice.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|but now they've got their P H D.
PS0ED|Mm mm.
PS0EB|you know it's so stupid in n it.
PS0ED|It's too young an age which to erm.
PS0EB|Assess like that.
PS0ED|judge judge people and and and split them like that.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0ED|Too young.
PS0EB|I mean it might be alright for the more intelligent people or whatever cos they get the best teachers then don't they But I mean for the other people it's just it's just rejection in n it you're not good enough.
PS0ED|Well I'm not stupid I mean I wasn't stu when I was at the junior schools in the country I wasn't stupid.
PS0EB|No.
PS0ED|but I went from there straight to there taking me eleven plus.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|I never had any practice at anything or and I should imagine they did I don't know I don't know how it worked.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|but I never had anything I just went from one to the another and I had to take it in the hall one day and I wasn't I was never very good at maths anyway not that kind of maths.
PS0EB|Not algebra oh we had this we.
PS0ED|I could never remember how to do them I mean if somebody if someone sat with me and explained it to me and then I and then I could do it I would do.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|it then for that lesson but after that I couldn't remember again how to do it.
PS0EB|That's that's just like me that is if I get into a rhythm and someone gives er I can do it then but if I just sit on a page I think oh how do you do that.
PS0ED|Mm I can never remember the formulas like your dad said formula for such and such a thing is so and so and that but I could never remember them so I was no good then because I couldn't remember it.
PS0EB|Mm them nice.
PS0ED|and then there was St Joseph's which was private.
PS0EB|Mm mm there was only one in Redditch.
PS0ED|What grammar school Where was that.
PS0EB|Ulster grammar.
PS0ED|Where.
PS0EB|Ulster.
PS0ED|Ulster Ulster.
PS0EB|Ulster.
PS0ED|no that's in Ireland Ulster.
PS0EB|Ulster.
PS0ED|Ulster's in Ireland.
PS0EB|Ulster erm.
PS0ED|That's nowhere near Greenwich.
PS0EB|No but it's where all the.
PS0EB|went but you ain't good enough.
PS0ED|No I'm afraid I'm er was a bit thick.
PS0EB|If you weren't you went to Dudley High.
PS0ED|I was good at English history sport.
PS0EB|You ought to try taking some of them honestly they're so easy the exams are like history ah talk about easy spartan erm you could G C S E P E mum.
PS0ED|I don't think I could now I could of done then probably.
PS0EB|You remind me of bit eh you're like a bit what Joanne's like except Joanne's better at maths but she's not very good at English like when they were doing Animal Farm I had to explain that it was a parody of the Russian revolution and everything and she just sat there with her mouth open.
PS0ED|What did she go to see the other day that she reckon was a load of rubbish.
PS0EB|Duke of Duke of thingy it was er on at the Palace it was erm Duke of there was an advert for it in the paper the other day.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|she didn't know it was an opera you see.
PS0ED|Oh it was an opera was it.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EB|and I didn't like to say anything.
PS0ED|What did she go from school.
PS0EB|Yeah oh.
PS0ED|I should imagine Joanne not.
PS0EB|erm but you see they would of been the most aggravating little gits there because as soon as they found out they all started messing about then for three hours it was on could you imagine sitting in there with them lot for three hours.
PS0ED|What about the teachers I would of chucked them out and Mrs.
PS0EB|yes but mum you're not a teacher at the Leeds High.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|If you were it probably be a bit different than it actually is dad said to me once that if he that if he'd like been in charge of it we'd of gone to the Leeds and not St Augustine's.
PS0ED|Yeah he would of been cos he was he was he was on about that erm the.
PS0ED|said to him about it when we first came and er he said about when when we were on about sending and I don't they're going to a Catholic school and he says oh the Catholic schools around here aren't very good and the the Leeds and that are the best.
PS0EB|Yeah well he's all in with that isn't he.
PS0ED|What a load of rubbish.
PS0EB|He's he's the flipping governor isn't he He's one of the governors.
PS0ED|Where.
PS0EB|Up there.
PS0ED|What at the Leeds not at the Leeds he's at Dingleside.
PS0EB|Well he's at the Dingleside but he's involved with the P T A there.
PS0ED|Oh well.
PS0EB|and he's bound to bull up his own place isn't he I mean no one's gon na say oh yes my school's the best.
PS0ED|I don't think so I don't they're too they're too big.
PS0EB|What.
PS0ED|that's what I don't like about it.
PS0EB|It's not it's no bigger than our school.
PS0ED|Isn't it.
PS0EB|No.
PS0ED|It's not got the same discipline.
PS0EB|It's about the sa well it's might just a little bit bigger than our school about another hundred or something but that's that's a drop in the ocean when you've got seven hundred there that's like one in each class or something you know extra.
PS0ED|Still there's no discipline.
PS0EB|No discipline ah no discipline.
PS0EB|and er we were like we was on about you know like we were talking about the education system and everything in English and you know I told you they were on about people changing at eleven and everyone else in the class wanted the thirteen system except me it's only cos what they're used to.
PS0ED|Oh yes what they're used to what they always yeah I know.
PS0EB|but I mean but like I said I said I mean I went I went to the like I changed then I mean to be quite honest I didn't like it I didn't like it.
PS0ED|What the same people in school.
PS0EB|no I didn't I never liked it whether that was because I knew we weren't gon na be there or you know I just I was only there six months.
PS0ED|Mm you would of done eventually you would of got in alright once you were settled and that.
PS0EB|I you know I just I would of been alright if it was a bit more organised I don't.
PS0ED|I think.
PS0EB|know it never seemed quite very organised.
PS0ED|they sent it back I think I thought the twelve was was quite good actually I thought the twelve when they went up at twelve but then when they changed it back to the junior and infants it was the elev the eleven and it was a bit I think it you know eleven might be perhaps too young I think twelve is a reasonable.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0ED|age.
PS0EB|But you see I was thrown from one teacher all the time Miss all the time.
PS0ED|Yeah to that.
PS0EB|to to German French Latin.
PS0ED|Yeah.
PS0EB|er you know proper algebra and all that kind of stuff and it and it was I think I would of been better if I had of gone to Our Ladies cos I don't.
PS0ED|Well I don't know I mean it would of still been the same if you'd of gone to Our Ladies it would of still been one one.
PS0EB|One teacher.
PS0ED|Yeah.
PS0EB|was there.
PS0ED|Yeah I think so.
PS0EB|I know but.
PS0ED|yeah because they were the only one who would.
PS0ED|didn't we.
PS0EB|I know but that at St Hughes you're stuck in a little rut aren't you I mean.
PS0ED|Well the trouble is you got to be the eldest and you were the eldest for such a long time.
PS0EB|You mean we were the eldest for five years there.
PS0ED|Yeah because you go to be the eldest and then just at the time you should of gone on and become the youngest it changed so you were the eldest all the time.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|and that made the difference I think that probably made the difference.
PS0EB|That particularly didn't bother me it was the regime the sudden change in the regime.
PS0ED|Yeah.
PS0EB|you know I think I would of got used to it.
PS0ED|Oh I.
PS0EB|but you know.
PS0ED|I feel surprised that I put how thick was she.
PS0EB|What No well you're not thick are you.
PS0ED|So this is where you two get all this.
PS0EB|what.
PS0ED|supposedly cleverness.
PS0EB|Supposedly when I when I told Nicola the other day that you reckon that I don't do enough work she says cor blimey she was shocked she was shocked oh do it do it as near to the microphone as you can mum.
PS0ED|What she doesn't want does she.
PS0ED|I don't think er I don't think you do do work enough work either of you really I mean if I sat an eleven plus today by what if they ever brought it back it'll be a lot different than what it was then.
PS0EB|I.
PS0ED|it'd be easy wouldn't it.
PS0EB|It wouldn't of been easier.
PS0ED|Well it would it would of it'd be easier I think it would.
PS0EB|Not to everybody it wouldn't.
PS0ED|Well I think I think I think to be honest they've all got easier.
PS0EB|I'd say they'd got harder you should see some of the things we do in maths mum it's not easy.
PS0ED|No I know that that's it's not easier now you know but I think er that would be easier wouldn't it.
PS0EB|You know I mean you the problem with you and dad is cos you never got particularly involved with it you don't you don't know exactly what's happening at school you don't know what we do.
PS0ED|Well I've never got particularly involved with this school I got involved with the other schools.
PS0EB|I know but mum that that was that was five years ago I mean I've moved on a great deal since then.
PS0ED|Oh yeah I know it's not no I know it's not easy I don't try to make out it's easy.
PS0EB|I mean some some of them are what what I would deem as fairly easy I mean I find history easy but not everyone does.
PS0ED|Oh no I know that I know that I mean some people find some things easy some people find some things hard don't they But I mean that's er a fact of life.
PS0EB|You know but I mean there's no way easy especially the science and maths equals I times R voltage and resistance in electricity and magnesium.
PS0EB|what.
PS0EB|but er that fibbing git Tim right he's got a locker next to me and he's got velcro on his coat and if I'm standing at my locker and he takes his coat out of out of his locker it always flipping pull my tights with the velcro.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|that's the third time he's done it I had such a go at him.
PS0ED|You'll have to charge him.
PS0EB|I'll have to I had a bit of major benny actually ha it was rather shocking wasn't it.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|Not that I ever have major bennies or anything.
PS0ED|No no.
PS0EB|I hadn't had a benny for a few days actually.
PS0ED|Oh.
PS0EB|I'm doing well thought I died and gone to heaven I don't like plain chocolate it's horrible.
PS0ED|Shit.
PS0EB|take a.
PS0ED|pardon.
PS0EB|Nothing sarky remark on my own just.
PS0ED|Ha there was this girl in the club last night and somebody shouted at her and she went what Oh dear I said to your dad Jesus.
PS0EB|Ladylike.
PS0ED|as common as muck what she goes.
PS0EB|I thought I could give dad some of these and then eat them all myself.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|for his birthday.
PS0ED|Well why not I don't think that'll go down very well.
PS0EB|Don't you.
PS0ED|No.
PS0EB|Well I'm really shocked mum I was really going to do it honest.
PS0ED|Mm I don't think so Helena Rosanne.
PS0EB|Eh what you do to me all my.
PS0EB|chuck me in there chuck me in the closet hit me with your rhythm stick hit me hard and hit me quick.
PS0ED|Hit me hit me what's the time sixo'clock isn't it.
PS0EB|What.
PS0ED|Sixo'clock.
PS0EB|What's sixo'clock.
PS0ED|The time.
PS0EB|it's half six.
PS0ED|Oh half six that was it yeah.
PS0EB|That's what it said on his little card.
PS0ED|Yes we thought he was going to somewhere else at sixo'clock.
PS0EB|Nicola didn't believe me when I told her she thought I was playing a joke.
PS0ED|What.
PS0EB|When I told her about this.
PS0ED|Didn't she.
PS0EB|I goes er oh I'm recording it for this thing she goes oh yeah my beard ha I was going I am ha but she didn't believe me can I have some sauce please There was definitely no chance of a walk that day bit of Jayne Eyre there for you.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|Oops that's what I call an honourary delight this is.
PS0ED|Mhm indeed.
PS0EB|What.
PS0ED|Indeed.
PS0EB|Indeed what exciting lessons did you have to do.
PS0ED|Nothing too exciting.
PS0EB|Well I had er oh what did I have Something P E maths English and graphics science science maths English and graphic.
PS0ED|How comes you're so you're so interested in the eleven plus and everything.
PS0EB|We're having a discussion about erm whether it should be brought back.
PS0ED|Oh.
PS0EB|I said definitely not cos it makes rejects of people in society therefore a what.
PS0EB|which they all do in my class cos they're all thick I couldn't believe it right.
PS0ED|Well they're all supposedly got intelligent parents by the sou by the sound of things.
PS0EB|Oh not all of them I was sat I I was sat there.
PS0ED|All thick like me.
PS0EB|and I went who's applying to go on to university or education after eighteen so I put up my hand turned round and flipping Stuart and Danny had put their hands up and I just went oh god they're gon na do really well and Terry and Terry we're talking Terry Terry who hasn't got a brain cell to rub together.
PS0ED|What er mm he's in your class ain't he.
PS0EB|so ah that boy this is the one who said I think we should be allowed to hit girls.
PS0EB|he supposedly he two short planks does not describe this boy even Miss hates him that was it she we were having this discussion right in education she goes are you cynical about education Terry he goes no he goes oh she goes why He goes I don't know what cynical means.
PS0EB|I said ah no and everyone in the class just cracked up sometimes you wonder you wonder whether he does it on purpose he must do it on purpose no one can be that thick.
PS0ED|How many was thinking of going on.
PS0EB|Ninety five per cent.
PS0ED|Yeah oh.
PS0EB|but erm like Vicky who's got in her English folder this is Vicky Vicky she's got in her literature she's got nineA's and one B and in her other I don't know what she's got tenA's probably mm she's not going to she wants to be a nurse.
PS0ED|Oh does she.
PS0EB|and er like she said aren't you Vicky and she goes no miss mm you can't be a nurse till your eighteen.
PS0ED|No no you can't go into student student.
PS0EB|so like you know she's gon na stay on do A levels and then go into it.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|because she might as well have some A levels just in case or whatever but erm you know I you know she's you know I can understand that actually she's being quiet sensible about it she said there's nothing else I want to do and I might as well do something that I enjoy you know you've only got one life haven't you when it comes down to it.
PS0ED|Well if that's what she wants to do that's what she wants to do in n it.
PS0EB|Mm like her dad says to her why don't you be a doctor and she but she don't want to you know she wants to be in a hospital and that she don't want to end up in general practice.
PS0ED|Well she doesn't necessarily end up in general practice does she.
PS0EB|No but.
PS0ED|But I mean for the first year she won't be in if she goes into student she'll be in college.
PS0EB|I know but it won't take as long for her to get there as it would if she becomes a doctor.
PS0ED|Oh no three years ain't it a student.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0ED|But then you get on hand experience right hands on I should say not on hand.
PS0EB|but erm.
PS0ED|learning how to clean pot pa er bed pans and make beds and things like that.
PS0EB|Clear up sick that's a favourite job isn't it.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|Yeah I thought of being that once but I wouldn't mind it in the wards but I wouldn't want to be in the operating theatre I don't know why the blood don't put me off or anything but.
PS0ED|You do have to go into the theatre for so long I think.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0ED|but then you can you can specialize you see I mean some nurses go into the theatre all the time once they've qualified.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0ED|I think they do have to go in you have to go into each area.
PS0EB|But like I mean I don't mind the blood or whatever and if they were doing little things I could handle it but like like on that op operation that woman was having the other day and they cut her open and they just pulled.
PS0ED|Well they do.
PS0EB|and that that that's the thing that makes me retch not the cutting it's when they just pull it apart.
PS0ED|Well I know.
PS0EB|when it rips ooh they could of cut it.
PS0ED|Well they do cut it.
PS0EB|No they cut the skin and then they just pulled it apart.
PS0ED|Yes because it's not the like that underneath if they didn't pull it apart they they cut down if they cut down with a knife they could cut into something couldn't they.
PS0EB|Oh er.
PS0ED|It could be dangerous so you you open up the top and then the other parts the lining.
PS0EB|Ah.
PS0EB|Yeah but what they ripped was all fat all her fat ooh.
PS0ED|Yeah but you see you've got the you got all the other things in down down underneath well I mean if you started going in with a knife and you started cutting them I mean you could cut an artery or anything couldn't you Which could be a bit nasty you know and then she'd say buy a little bag for me a chick a chick a chick a chickita.
PS0ED|who's turn is it tonight.
PS0EB|Oh mine oh I wish it was David probably never get.
PS0ED|We've seen it on T V.
PS0ED|flower.
PS0EB|but I was listening to myself on that.
PS0ED|Mm.
PS0EB|Oh is my laugh vile or what and my voice.
PS0EB|it sounds so idiotic.
PS0ED|That's cos you be a country yoke.
