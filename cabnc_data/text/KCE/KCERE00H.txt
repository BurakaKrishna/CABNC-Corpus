PS0EE|They came in today to give us this talk about kind of er kind of erm money we're gon na get whatever today you know like they said about the Poll Tax.
PS0EH|You want one on you want one on.
PS0EB|Eh.
PS0EE|said here about the Poll Tax.
PS0EH|What it say.
PS0EE|Well it was with every community charge benefits and everything.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EE|said said that at the moment we're paying twenty per cent twenty per cent er Poll Tax erm we're on about thirty five pound a week the full grant that's how much we get you know if you level it out you know.
PS0EB|get the full grant.
PS0EE|Yeah well like you know the full the grant is two thousand whatever.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EE|two thousand whatever not you're saying that parents subsidize that you know.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EE|whatever you whatever your grant is whether it's eight hundred pounds parents subsidize that up to the two thousand whatever.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EE|erm up to the grant status and then everybody should be on two er thirty er thirty six pound a week out of that's got to come everything you've got everything you've got to pay for to drink whatever.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0EE|and erm like I said up to about up to about two years ago you could claim housing benefit with which you could pay your rent and that was a great help to students you know but now that's been stopped but you don't get anything like that so you've got thirty five pound a week to pay for food rent community charge everything.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EE|right you should of seen the look on everybody's face.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EE|like you just they just went oh and but I think it's finally I mean I was in the.
PS0EE|about how much it's you know what a struggle it is yeah.
PS0EB|Well you knew cos we told you.
PS0EE|I knew what it was.
PS0EB|what you get.
PS0EE|but everybody thinks that it's gon na be easy.
PS0EB|Yeah because they think they're going to get more don't they Or they thought they were and the only people they're going to get any more from is the parents nowhere else nobody else is going to give them anything I've got no illusions about it I don't expect you to get anything from anywhere else and I know that you you wouldn't get anything from anywhere else because they they've cut it they've cut it to the bone and the only people that can afford to go now and to live in anything like.
PS0EE|A decent.
PS0EB|Yeah is people who have got rich parents.
PS0EE|It's like Jane her her mum and dad her her dad's rich they're er is rich is oh er.
PS0EB|Lives at Bromsground.
PS0EE|Yeah.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EE|he's oh oh.
PS0EE|and Claire said to me oh well Labour if Labour get in we'll get we'll get a you know we'll be much better off we'll get a much better grant er Jane goes but oh we'll get we'll get every erm my mum and dad will get loads of other things er dad I won't be able to pay for it I goes well no because you probably get you get the housing benefit back.
PS0EH|You won't get better grants you won't though cos it won't have time to work through.
PS0EB|No it might it might.
PS0EE|But you will do.
PS0EB|be the year after.
PS0EE|Yeah.
PS0EH|Yeah well for the last year.
PS0EE|but I think.
PS0EB|I think I think actually I think they will try to do something actually because if they if they do away with the loans thing.
PS0EH|Yeah.
PS0EB|they'll have to try do something won't they.
PS0EH|I know the way I know but.
PS0EB|To be honest.
PS0EH|you don't it's not going to be you.
PS0EH|just because you vote for Labour.
PS0EB|oh no no it's not no.
PS0EE|No I mean of course not.
PS0EH|and then they can't say alright oh students give them hundred pound a week he give them none give them none.
PS0EB|no they can't do that because of the state of the economy.
PS0EH|and then if.
PS0EE|I know that but.
PS0EH|You've got to be realistic like ain't you.
PS0EE|but surely but surely I mean surely they'll be able to restore the housing benefit.
PS0EB|Well hopefully they'll be able to do something.
PS0EE|Well it says in that in that thing I've got they're gon na restore a fair system of grants.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EE|of grants that's that's the thing I looked at it didn't say a fair grant.
PS0EB|No.
PS0EE|it said grants.
PS0ED|Yeah.
PS0EE|so I mean even if they don't bring in oh the housing benefit.
PS0EB|But I mean.
PS0EE|they'll bring in something a housing grant.
PS0EB|you know I mean on.
PS0EH|to to my to my mind when.
PS0EB|on April the tenth they're not going to be able to go.
PS0ED|No when they hear it all day.
PS0EB|oh you know that's that's it because for thirteen years they have dismantled the social system that's what they've done in thirteen years so they can't say overnight we'll put it all back because there isn't there there isn't the finance there because they've spent it all to have done what they've done.
PS0ED|Yeah.
PS0EB|because they've sold everything off like gas and electricity and everything and all the resources they've got for it they've spent to supplement everything else so the money won't be there and and the income from the electricity and that isn't going to the Government it's going to private enterprise.
PS0EE|Yeah.
PS0EB|so so it's not gon na be there and unfortunately it's going to take a while because we're in such a deep recession and recession is bad and it's not getting any better.
PS0EE|Yeah it won't.
PS0EE|any more.
PS0EH|What.
PS0EB|It it'll take a long time before it starts to buck up.
PS0EH|Why why do they say that for the election it will take them three or four years to put whatever they promise into operation.
PS0EB|Yeah to put it right to start to put it right.
PS0EE|Well they're they're education promises are we'll do this within two years we'll do this within.
PS0EH|Yeah.
PS0EE|three years.
PS0EB|yeah well I mean they'll want to and they've got.
PS0EH|within three years you're leaving.
PS0EB|Yeah but they've got.
PS0ED|They've got to help people like me but I don't know.
PS0EB|they've got to try and show.
PS0EH|what you shouldn't think.
PS0EB|that they are doing something.
PS0EE|You should just you this is what I'm trying to tell.
PS0EH|you shouldn't think what's it going to do to me.
PS0EE|this is what I'm trying to tell everybody at school you shouldn't be thinking oh how's it gon na effect me what I'll do if.
PS0EH|No.
PS0EB|No because you should help think of a society as whole.
PS0EE|because that this is the I said to this kid the other day he goes oh like Ian was arguing with them when I went in.
PS0EH|Yeah.
PS0EE|and he was going oh all what the Tories haven't done for you and he goes and what are Labour gon na do for us I goes well they'll improve the grant to start off with he goes well it won't be in time to benefit us I goes well you shouldn't just be thinking about yourself.
PS0EB|No.
PS0EH|No that's the trouble with people.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EE|They're just they're just bothered about about themselves.
PS0ED|Everyone everyone thinks of themselves it's like on their all them people who are under that certain amount they're all gon na be going oh well in here.
PS0EH|Yeah.
PS0ED|we'll vote for them then.
PS0EH|Yeah.
PS0ED|and people do that don't they.
PS0EE|Well it's like it's like Richard today he goes well what well what are Labour gon na do for us So I goes well they'll probably they'll probably erm er give better grants and restore erm er housing benefit of sorts whatever happens.
PS0EB|Well is he going to university.
PS0EE|Yeah.
PS0EB|What doing.
PS0EE|Du n no.
PS0EE|or something and he goes.
PS0EB|But the only I think the only course he'll pass is mucking about course let's see who can muck about for the next three years the most.
PS0ED|I can't understand it they've got to have a decent grade to go to university but they seem to think that they can get in onD's andE's if he getsD's andE's he's not going anywhere except to work.
PS0EE|No I I wouldn't I wouldn't expect it I reckon.
PS0ED|because I mean because.
PS0EH|come on.
PS0ED|He ain't because to me you you not got you're wasting your time.
PS0EB|Stupid in n it If you haven't got if you haven't got enough discipline to get a good grade in your O levels.
PS0ED|in school then you're not.
PS0EB|then you no way gon na have enough discipline to get any sort of grade at university.
PS0ED|because you live in.
PS0EH|That's for the testing in n it.
PS0ED|Yeah because I mean you're living at home when your doing A levels you you haven't even got.
PS0EB|And you got.
PS0ED|the discipline of your parents to say get up there and do something have you.
PS0EH|No.
PS0EE|But some people don't Adeleine got that his parents don't tell him to get on with it half half the people at school they got that.
PS0ED|Well if I didn't I mean I don't think you do enough either of you do enough but in you know I mean.
PS0EB|Do you know what I was talking to Nicola.
PS0ED|I don't care what other people do I'm saying I don't think you.
PS0EE|So so what kind.
PS0ED|do enough either of you.
PS0EE|so what kind of time have I got at the moment.
PS0EH|No you ain't got.
PS0ED|Well I know you're doing that but you still got.
PS0EE|Yeah but.
PS0ED|to find time to do your work because your exams are still going to be on the same day aren't they.
PS0EE|I know I'm doing my work at school I've but.
PS0EH|I know you ain't got a lot of time now it's I mean they when it's important to that's just important to do what you're doing now actually because there's yeah.
PS0ED|Well yes I know it is but the exams are still on the same day.
