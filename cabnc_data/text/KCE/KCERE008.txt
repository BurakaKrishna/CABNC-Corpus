PS0EF|Yeah well I mean I was there and all they did was they didn't say anything to each other in the same room just acted totally normally but didn't say anything to each other Shrimpy's trying his flipping nice to try and let this drop and just We all know he still fancies her he's just trying to you know keep it he's just trying to forget it and try and act as normal as possible with her and hopefully things will get back to be back to what what they were But flipping Scott mister interferior.
PS0EB|Interferior.
PS0EF|Yeah interferer Flipping no it really annoys me that does They're always going on about how much Shrimpy gets other people involved and can't stick up for himself aren't they And bloody Scott runs rushing off and thinks he's mister hard man What sort of things are you gon na say anyway.
PS0EB|Well I'm just gon na I'm just gon na say that Joanne's a bit worried about Shrimpy which is true.
PS0EF|Yeah.
PS0EB|you know And I'm just gon na say you know I think it would be better if Scott didn't rush in like that you know I can understand why he did it to be quite honest.
PS0EF|Yeah but you say to her that they're always on about how s Shrimpy can't do anything for himself and it's between Emma it's not between it was al even Scott said to me at the beginning oh it's not between me it's nothing to do with me it's between Emma and Scott.
PS0EB|Emma and Shrimpy.
PS0EF|Emma and Shrimpy then And erm he's been then he rushes ahead full storm don't he.
PS0EB|Mm He shouldn't have done that really he was a bit naughty.
PS0EF|He sh she ought to learn to sh she's they was all on about how Shrimpy can't stick up for himself and then flaming Emma does exactly the same but worse cos she gets Scott to do it for her She's gon na have to one of these I'm not being funny but she can't stick up for herself that girl can't It's about time she had the courage to do it herself if she's in a strop There's no point getting Scott cos what's gon na happen when she finishes with Scott She really.
