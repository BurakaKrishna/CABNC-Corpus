PS0EB|Mm.
PS0EC|And erm and then like he went back in after we'd finished playing and me and Scott carried on playing for a bit and then erm what was he going Oh yeah he told me afterwards right that he the only reason he was angry was because Friday night reminded him of the time in his past or something And Pete reminded him of him of the person that he hated and all this And I was thinking Shrimpy you're stupid.
PS0EB|Get a life.
PS0EC|You sure Oh And then cos I thought boy.
PS0EB|So what did he do What did Shrimpy do on Friday night.
PS0EC|Oh he told Richard Richard that he was he was gon na se he wanted to smack Pete's face in Oh yeah.
PS0EC|So what did Richard do.
PS0EC|Course Richard who keeps everything to himself.
PS0EB|Richard not known as Mersey Tunnel Gob or anything.
PS0EB|Oh dear.
PS0EC|Oh dear I couldn't believe it though I mean that is sad.
PS0EB|Ahhh no I can't believe it But Pete reckoned it was because like cos like Pete's seeing Susan.
PS0EC|Mm.
PS0EB|and like.
PS0EC|Then he was with you.
PS0EB|and he was with me.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|and he reckoned Pete was a total bastard and everything Even though he doesn't know Susan he a.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|he reckons Pete's cheating on Susan he's been really bad to Helena as well he's just using them and all.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|this business.
PS0EC|But in a way I mean like I thought that as well but then I thought well that's stupid that is because you weren't as as bad as Pete was were you I mean let's face it.
PS0EB|I mean who's taking advantage of him.
PS0EC|You were ta you were taking advantage not him.
PS0EB|I mean on both times it's been me taking advantage of him it really.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|because.
PS0EC|I mean he.

PS0EC|Let's face it you fancy him don't you He knows that And.
PS0EB|Mm mm.
PS0EC|like he just I mean he just you know he's there isn't he at the time.
PS0EC|He thinks like okay fair enough lets have a bit of snog you know fair enough whatever else But like.
PS0EB|He's so funny though He cracked me up he goes like like with that I mean.
PS0EC|And Shrimpy fancies you rotten anyway That's the only the reason He's probably just jealous.
PS0EB|Well like I said I said that I said that to Pete and Pete goes God I wish he'd make up his mind.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|So he'd obviously sa not said it I mean Pete was really shocked He'd.

PS0EB|obviously not said anything to Pete about me.
PS0EC|Mm.
PS0EB|so I du n no.
PS0EC|He said it to Andy though and I mean I don't I don't know Andy really surprises me because like he always seems to be like the quiet one doesn't it I mean when we're all like laughing and joking and everything he's like oh yeah really in with it but when everyone's like arguing or whatever he he.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0EC|doesn't get involved because everything revolves round him doesn't it.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EC|But like everybody eve.
PS0EB|It's his house everyone goes to isn't it.
PS0EC|Everybody seems to Andy seems to know everything Like Andy knows about me And like Scott told me and thinking about it if I'd of been in in the frame frame of mind that I'm in know for example I would of sort of pah What right has he got to know or anything But like I don't mind cos I know he won't say anything.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0EC|I mean flipping talk about keeping it a secret I went to the door last night ten minutes after Scott had told him and like I was crying at the door and he goes ahh is something not wrong like you know And he was being nice but sort of jokingly nice and I goes oh yeah you know And er he goes oh I don't expect has it got anything to do with Helena and Joan I said oh no nothing to do with them and he goes ah Shrimpy then I said no And like I'd no idea that he knew.

PS0EC|erm like he's really nice like that though.
PS0EB|Yeah I know.
PS0EC|I re I'd I mean I don't fancy him no fair enough he's ugly in my opinion.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EC|But I really do like I'm I'm always.

PS0EC|But like erm pyjamas cos you know I wo I usually wear those ones with like low neck or like.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EC|my babygro or something.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0EC|So like there was me sort of all of a sudden wearing like old and stuff in bed so that I'd got quite high collars and mum was sort of going.
PS0EC|aren't your pyjamas clean Yeah they're clean but I wan na clear up spots on my back Yeah still wan na clear up the spots on my back Can you see through here mum.
PS0EC|Oh dear.
PS0EB|I mean I mean it wo that was pro the lightest one on my.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|neck.
PS0EC|That was lucky really in a way.
PS0EB|Oh.
PS0EC|isn't it.
PS0EB|And I was thinking oh I wa honestly I didn't know they were there.
PS0EC|But like Scott was going to me he was going to me oh stop complaining or I'll give you one your tit like and I goes well I wouldn't mind so much if it was on my I wear a bra all the time.
PS0EC|you know I mean.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EC|you don't even take your bra off to do P E or whatever I mean no one's gon na see it there are they You're flipping massive one.
PS0EC|I du n no If Zena saw it and and made a a subtle comments like.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0EC|you know.
PS0EB|Oh got a nasty.
PS0EC|Ah.
PS0EB|bruise there.
PS0EC|Yeah actually se I sa actually she said oh what have you been walking into this time.
PS0EC|Hah shut up Shut up before I punch your face in But like erm no one else saw it But I tell you what it was so embarrassing The it was the Mo the Monday after the Saturday got the Saturday it was done I had P E oh great.
PS0EC|So there's me like I'm sat in first lesson we have P E last lesson sat in the first lesson and I'm th I've thought God my bra strap feels really lose So I'm right I thought oh my God There's a gap in between they're not attached any more.
PS0EC|What would you do I mean like okay it wasn't bad I mean let's face it and I'm not exactly flipping Dolly Parton am I.
PS0EC|exploding everywhere wouldn't she But like I was thinking this is gon na be so embarrassing like in P E With ha half a bra on.
PS0EB|my cups down my cups down to my waist.
PS0EC|I sa I was sat there and and then we was in maths like the lesson before and I was going Zena I don't wan na do P E I just do not want to do P E And she's going why not You like P E I don't wan na do it Zena will you write me a letter to get me out of it She's going no I won't you know not unless you tell me what it i why it is you don't wan na do it So in the end I wro I wrote her this letter because I couldn't say it out loud in case anyone else heard me And say that I've busted my bra strap So she goes oh don't worry about it Like we go into the loo and like you can mend it.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0EC|So of course I've thought oh yeah that's all okay I thought cos like some of them have got the loop actually on the the like on the top of the cup haven't they.
PS0EB|Mm.
PS0EC|Did this one No The loop's attached to the end of the strap It's a bit of the cup that's actually come apart unsewn So that meant I had to get the part of the the top bit of the cup thread it through the hoo the hoop and then tie it in a knot So like you can imagine I had to have all the strap completely undone so like the the buckle was like down here.
PS0EC|And above the knot.
PS0EB|Comfortable then.
PS0EC|Well it wasn't it wasn't that bad but like it was really weird because like you could see like people like especially the lads just sort of looking at you and then like not meaning to be pervy but just like looking again as if to think why has Emma got a a extraordinary lump on half the top of her boob you know.
PS0EC|It's like a lump there They're thinking mm a shame But like it was alright then because like means that you can changed up in this one corner of the changing room all the time and so I'd got my shirt on while I was putting my on like for the reason that my bra strap was bust not actually because I'd got a gigantic love bite around my neck.
PS0EC|But like er.
PS0EB|But I mean.
PS0EC|So that was alright really.
PS0EB|But I couldn't believe it cos I he goes to me what do you think of love bites And I goes I think they're horrible to be quite honest I don't.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|like them.
PS0EC|Same as me I goes to Scott I really really hate love bites and er and he goes yeah and me The only time he's ever had one was at this kid's party Fran Franny someone he's actually a bloke.
PS0EB|Ooh that's.
PS0EC|I said that's he went to this party and he he was like really hard and he was really drunk and he gave Scott Noel and Ian a love bite like for a joke He just decided to do just for a laugh.
PS0EB|Oh how sick Ah what a gay.
PS0EC|I know like anyway but like Scott had gone home said to his mum like is his mum isn't going what's that on your neck You know woh what you been doing sort of thing And he's told her the whole story so Noel's gone home and his mum's gone what's that on your neck So Noel's gone oh someone tripped me up I fell down the stairs and hit it on the coffee table right His mum believed him So then his Scott's mum and Noel's mum met in town and they were just talking and Scott's mum it's dis God it's disgusting isn't it that lad given all them little lads love bites And er Noel's mum's going well what I don't know what you mean Noel said he'd hit it on the coffee table.
PS0EC|Next day at school Noel's come in and gone to Scott you bastard.
PS0EC|Why do you have go and tell your mum the truth for.
PS0EB|I'd never tell my mum that Like luckily they're.
PS0EC|Oh God.
PS0EB|no not very big but I've still got the one I've still got and it's right next to it as well.
PS0EC|Mm.
PS0EB|Now it's yellow now it's going.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|But ah.
PS0EC|Ah gee.
PS0EB|ah Jesus.
PS0EC|I think they're.
PS0EB|At least.
PS0EC|really disgusting Cos like Scott was going I've never gave anyone one you know And er Hannah's going we started off the conversation where was the perviest you've ever had one I mean knowing that I didn't have one ever had one before and that was Mark feeble attempt that lasted about ten minutes.
PS0EC|I think And I was really upset about that as you can imagine But like erm what was I saying Oh yeah so I was going what's the perviest place I was thinking you know Scotts bound to have some pervy ones off Mandy But like er and he was going oh I've never had one except for like this Franny bloke.
PS0EB|Girls don't do it to boys as much as boys do it to girls though do they.
PS0EC|No I know That is really sick though.
PS0EB|I certainly don't think so anyway.
PS0EC|I think that's really disgusting they look silly.
PS0EB|I think it looks awful on boys I mean it looks bad enough on girls but I mean.
PS0EC|I know it looks really cheap doesn't it.
PS0EB|Yeah.
PS0EC|Sort of like eh eh eh eh eh.
PS0EB|But I didn't that's why it's.
PS0EC|I'm a big slag.
PS0EB|that's why I.
PS0EC|Ha.
PS0EB|I didn't tell anybody.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|At school.
PS0EC|You didn't tell anyone like except Joe then told Stuart Mr.
PS0EB|Really funny But I ca honestly when Pete phoned me up and like I was getting so worried And he's going.
PS0EC|Yeah but I swear you should have heard Pete mouthing off at Joe.
PS0EB|I know.
PS0EC|And because like he didn't even know about the love bites Cos Scott goes to him cos we were talking about flipping biting other people's nipples or something.
PS0EB|He did he.
PS0EC|And.
PS0EB|he did actually bite me.
PS0EC|Yeah That's right.
PS0EB|He did.
PS0EC|he's really strange.
PS0EB|Well.
PS0EC|though.
PS0EB|it killed It really.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|hurt.
PS0EC|Well Scott does that.
PS0EB|I screamed.
PS0EC|all the time Like he doesn't think he doing it but it really doesn't it I mean like keeh God me.
PS0EB|I went I went.
PS0EC|God.
PS0EB|I actually went arghhh You've got ta to.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|And and like then like them two they're being and they goes what's up I goes nothing Nothing You know and it really hurt.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|But I mean but Joe said they were actual bite marks and it wasn't.
PS0EC|Yeah she did.
PS0EB|there wasn't actually bite marks but he did bite me but.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|they was like love bite marks.
PS0EC|Mm.
PS0EB|And I think so Pete wasn't right and she wasn't right either.
PS0EC|Yeah.
PS0EB|But.
PS0EC|But like he was really sounding off at Joe And like I mean he didn't know about that And Scott goes oh it's a good job it's a good he didn't give her a love bite.
PS0EC|And Pete's gone what I didn't did I And like everyone was just sat there going oh my God drool on the floor man you don't even know.
PS0EB|I've only got three.
PS0EC|But oh God.

PS0EC|Yeah Cos someone said last night they were going to Tramps but whether that was just like they might be going to Tramps or what This bra's too small I'll have to get a new one.

PS0EC|But like he goes on on and on don't he about how wonderful Susan is and then you know he gets drunk and that's it isn't it.
PS0EB|But like he even said it he said to me when I was drunk and I and it pissed me off a little bit actually cos like he goes to me you know like I I was saying about it and he goes erm well she was the one who wanted it all casual and everything and I said oh yeah And he goes he goes yeah well I do it because she does it.
