PS101|You think you no a colour until you try the er and the one I actually picked out when she measured it off she'd only got three yards and I needed four and a half.
PS102|Oh.
PS101|So she said I'm sorry so I got the next nearest I just can not waste any more time.
PS05X|What a pest.

PS101|Well also there's all the fittings fitting them round and trips to and all the other things.
PS102|What.
PS101|Erm it's not no the little ones are cos them going to be three quarters and it's got a full skirt with a an over panel and she's got frills in the back of her skirt and got an over panel over it can't describe it it is pretty and the neck is just slightly on the edge of the shoulder got a frill and no sleeves and the little ones got puff sleeves and high neck.
PS102|Hm.
PS101|They have that particular one because the two little girls wanted to be bridesmaid's have just been bridesmaid's and have these dresses and Anna thought the colour was so pretty cos she went into Laura Ashley and got one in the sale of last years stock.
PS102|Yeah.
PS101|For Layla seven pounds.
PS102|Oh gosh you wouldn't have done better than that that's for sure.
PS101|They do in adult size in.
PS102|Hm.
PS101|So they choose this fabric being the right.
PS102|Hm.
PS101|And the same type of fabric as Anna's dress.
PS102|I'm sure it'll look lovely if it I mean if you've got grown up bridesmaid's in every one you will expect seeing.
PS101|Anna actually chose the.
PS05X|I rather suspect that the I even said about the strong colour of the net I suspect that when.
PS101|Trouble with it.
PS05X|when it's a single thickness strong the colour won't be as strong as that anyway.
PS101|It looks it won't show anyway.
PS05X|No.
PS101|The underneath.
PS05X|Is it is it really just a puffer is it.
PS101|Veronica said if you can't get anything the right colour get white but white got a very starkly difference.
PS102|Yeah.
