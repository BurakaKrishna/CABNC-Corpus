PS05X|Thank you dear.
PS103|Mum did you make my sandwiches today.
PS101|No.
PS103|Didn't think so.
PS101|Should've made them.
PS103|They were nice.
PS05X|Were they nicer than usual.
PS103|No different.
PS05X|Different What was the difference.
PS103|Got prawns and garlic.
PS05X|What the flavour in the prawns you mean.

PS05X|Mm Looks very green dear.
PS103|It's lovely.
PS05X|Do you think I'm environmental.
PS103|Why did they choose you to tape.
PS05X|Ha there was a knock at the door.
PS103|Nah.
PS101|Nah or no.
PS05X|I'm to explain roughly what they're up to so I invited them in they then explained exactly what they were up to fine I'll do it.
PS103|I'll be pleased.
PS101|You can turn the radio off darling we're not listening to it.
PS103|They say you could borrow the Walkman.
PS05X|They gave me the equipment and the tapes and the batteries and eh the recorded paper and all the rest of it cos that's part essential part of the whole thing.
PS101|You hang handed back didn't you.
PS05X|Oh yes yes.
PS103|How many people are they taking then.
PS05X|I've no idea I didn't ask.
PS101|what work they use in general conversation these days.
PS05X|Oh accents things like that Spoken spoken English as opposed to record of written English that's the essence of it.
PS103|If I'd taken it the language would be different.
PS101|Of course but I think they'll have a wide.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|variety of people otherwise their research isn't valid is it.
PS05X|Yes the the lady in question was saying what she had to have I think I think what she was saying was that for every person over forty five she had to have somebody under forty five.
PS101|Presumably the same number of men as women and.
PS05X|Yeah probably.
PS103|What do you have to stand there when you walk down the street and when you go to.
PS101|Only when you're having a conversation.
PS05X|When I answer the telephone I switch it off I done that numerous times today but I'm trying to do it right by keeping it going all the time when I'm likely to be in conversation so there are occasional blank spaces on the tapes.
PS05X|It was quite funny yesterday because he when I went out in the garden there was a football nestling in the rose bushes I heaved it back over the fence thirty seconds later the two boys came roaring out of the house and about thirty seconds after that.
PS103|It's back over again.
PS05X|it no it's up in the app top of the apple tree and they were chucking sticks at it trying to get it down again.
PS103|Why don't you just open the back gate so that they can come and collect their stuff when they want it.
PS05X|Well I've said it actually if you do it frequently you can't be bothered I suppose.
PS101|Probably their dad said you mustn't go in there too often.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|It takes snob.
PS103|You'll be pleased to know dad that I am going to go to the tomorrow night.
PS101|Oh.
PS05X|Oh no.

PS103|Mm.
PS05X|utterly overwhelmed dear why.

PS103|Judith.
PS101|I find that hard to believe how she.
PS101|Pardon.
PS103|Exactly.
PS05X|So Sam doesn't like her either.
PS103|Mm.
PS101|It's not so much not liking it's not really trusting people like us.
PS05X|I think not liking must come into it partly.
PS103|Mm.
PS05X|Mean to say that that's the honest.
PS101|It doesn't mean it doesn't endear you to people does it.
PS05X|No exactly not likely my dear.
PS103|No I don't dislike Judith.
PS101|No quite.

PS103|They come there's two of us Anita.
PS101|Sarah doesn't.
PS103|Yeah can't afford.

PS101|Why don't you stay for school lunch instead of sandwiches.
PS05X|Is there still a boycott at the canteen.
PS103|No.
PS05X|Is that because they've got fed up or because things have improved.
PS103|Probably got fed up.
PS05X|Nothing's improved.
PS101|How can you at college I mean I know there's your course but I didn't know about that until you enrolled for it I've only heard of it at the fashion college.
PS101|Hairdressing.

PS103|They did they come in and they us and then they go home again.
PS101|Who are they.
PS103|Nobody knows.
PS05X|I think you should do a survey approach them with a clipper board as they come in and say.
PS101|Which course you on.
PS05X|delighted to see you.
PS103|Well it's a joke because they take up all the seats like they're in two seats of four and a there is no way you can half the students these silly old people come in and they take up four seats and eat our lunch.
PS101|You for everybody.
PS103|Yeah but at times they're expensive.
PS101|Shouldn't be the more people that eat it the cheaper it the should help keep the prices down.
PS103|Yeah but they do though.
PS05X|Certainly.
PS101|Perhaps it's the college's bit of charity.
PS05X|Even the canteen staff don't know who they are.
PS103|Bet they do.
PS101|Ladies from the street with poor with poor pensions.
PS103|Yeah they're regulars they come in every day.
PS101|Mm.
PS05X|I don't think eh college of fashion should be supporting the ladies of the streets dear.
PS103|I like it though.
PS101|Maybe they're the cleaners.
PS05X|You mean bag ladies or street ladies.
PS103|Bag ladies.
PS05X|Aha.
PS103|I know they're definitely not cleaners.
PS101|Do you.
PS103|No Right one woman she comes in with an ice cream tub and fills up with food and goes home in an ice cream tub.
PS101|She must be very poor.
PS103|Erm you don't know you know because the more our college prices keep going up and up B H S on it they are cheaper than our corned beef.
PS103|Yeah well.
PS05X|Why do a er an old lady come in and fill up an ice cream tub do you mean an old ice cream tub.
PS103|Yeah.
PS101|She brings one with her.
PS103|Yeah.
PS05X|So where she fill it up from.

PS103|It's hers put a.
PS103|Ice cream tub.
PS05X|Does she pay for it.
PS103|I don't think so.

PS103|erm how come the bar meals used to be so cheap when the canteen's.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|Of course there's a big profit.
PS101|It seems to me this student bar does have to make a vast profit Anyway it's probably run by students.
PS103|Yeah it is.
PS05X|Is there bar students Is there a steward.
PS101|Might be a man in charge but they probably don't have to pay lots of wages.
PS103|There is there No.
PS101|And make lots of profit.
PS103|But I don't think it makes any profit but you know profit.
PS103|That's why it's cheap.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|Whereas pubs are different they are out they have to pay a lot of people and their rent and everything else and they are ours to make a profit.
PS101|Except for a small diversion and nibble some bits of lamb when I was cutting up the meat lunchtime and to try and serving of it.
