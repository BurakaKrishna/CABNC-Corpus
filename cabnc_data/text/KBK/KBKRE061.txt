PS05X|David is looking for somewhere to put his croquet club.
PS101|What do you mean by that.
PS05X|Well he's got a croquet club without a ground.
PS101|Oh you mean a club A number of people not a club stick It's not called like a golf club that you hit the ball with.
PS05X|Ah Correct He's looking for ground land.
PS101|Not looking much of a hurry.
PS05X|What's that thing out there hydrants or something.
PS101|On which to play croquet.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|He occasionally he gets by the club.
PS101|Uncomfortable next to the Tigers.
PS05X|Excuse me.
PS101|Erm Yes he was he is the Secretary of Eden Park Croquet Club which was an offshoot of Eden Park Cricket Club.
PS05X|Where is Eden Park.
PS101|It's between Beckenham and Croydon And.
PS05X|They don't have anywhere to play.
PS101|at the moment they don't have anywhere to play.
PS05X|What do you need for a croquet club.
PS101|Well you need ideally some space for about four or five tennis courts to run.
PS05X|Quite a lot.
PS101|Well that would run you three lawns.
PS05X|How big is a lawn.
PS101|which would be ideal.
PS05X|As big as a tennis court.
PS101|I believe it's twenty four by sixteen ideally.
PS05X|Is that bigger than a tennis court.
PS101|It's about the size of a double tennis court apparently.
PS05X|Double tennis court.
PS101|Mhm.
PS05X|Gosh.
PS101|With the surrounds.
PS05X|Presumably you can't use it for anything else because it needs to be very smooth and perfect Is there cold air blowing in this car.
PS101|It's hot air blowing in.
PS05X|I know any air but something's blowing You can erm you can't use it for anything else but croquet.
PS101|No But then it's not a very big area You know as you can't use a tennis court for anything else or bowling green for anything else.
PS05X|No But it does sound quite a big area to me if you haven't got the land in the first place It would mean somebody's got to give up something.
PS101|You could fit it on a bowling green.
PS05X|But then who wants to give up a bowling green.
PS101|Well I'm talking of space The area you need.
PS05X|You've got the area That's fine but you haven't got any land at all.
PS101|Mm.
PS05X|It's quite a lot of land to find.
PS101|Absolutely true.
PS05X|It's not like somebody's back garden.
PS101|Yep.
PS05X|So where were they playing today.
PS101|They went to Dulwich.
PS05X|Is there a croquet club there.
PS101|Yes Burbidge Road Which is where Carlos used to live.
PS05X|How many croquet clubs are there around here.
PS101|Very few Sydenham is possible ran an evening class affair.
PS05X|Not one in Bromley.
PS101|No There's nothing in Bromley Apparently the Mayor last year or the Mayoress er was rather keen and organized a match between the Dulwich Club and her team nominally which turned out to be made up of masters from Dulwich College Well apparently they have a lawn and they play it.
PS05X|Well yes people who play.
PS101|Oh you need people who know the game anyway Then.
PS05X|Oh no You need to know how to play.
PS101|Oh indeed you do Mighty complicated it is too.
PS05X|Well I was reading that article in the Sunday Times with you and the chap who's the champion said he liked it because it's like chess and bridge.
PS101|Mm Mm.
PS05X|A game of strategy.
PS101|Or I mean David was saying you can do this you can do that you can do the other you can do this I I my mind was absolutely blown by the end It it was almost impossible to erm.
PS05X|If you were.
PS101|latch on to everything.
PS05X|starting out out Doing it from scratch If somebody was used to teaching croquet they wouldn't tell you everything all at once And you can gradually build up.
PS101|Well he was coaching me and he was very good.
PS05X|Oh good.
PS101|Very good I can understand why he has been invited to coach Very good.
