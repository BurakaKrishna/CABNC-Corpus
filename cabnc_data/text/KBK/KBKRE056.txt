PS107|That's the trouble having got this far.
PS05X|I mean you having stood there I was deliberately aiming to to strike that one.
PS107|got straight through it.
PS05X|Going straight through anyway right fine I'm not capable of these weeny deflections anyway so I don't know why the heck I'm bothering.
PS107|Always try to be behind the other ball when you come through the hoop because you're going that way you see.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|Erm but erm what I really wanted to do was to cover about.
PS05X|Oh oh sorry it's it's the next one we're aiming at the one we're aiming at isn't it yes.
PS107|Yes so to cut red down near that black ball is lovely.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|There is a danger of red ball you have a cut.
PS05X|Right O K.
PS107|Hit it on the right.
PS05X|Yep.
