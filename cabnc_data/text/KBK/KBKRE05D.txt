PS05X|Presumably when you do land in a position like that even though as you say you're getting near the end of the game for the blue ball you wouldn't deliberately not go through the hoop if you'll put in that if you put yourself in that position.
PS05X|You no you you'd of played away.
PS05X|Yes.
PS05X|Right right.
PS107|Now I've really got to start thinking about where I want the ball to be.
PS05X|Mm.
PS107|When a it would be nice to have yellow that yellow's fairly near the hoop.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|so if I can get that.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|Mm.
PS05X|Shall I go and get the tea.
PS107|Oh excellent.
PS05X|Thank you very much.
