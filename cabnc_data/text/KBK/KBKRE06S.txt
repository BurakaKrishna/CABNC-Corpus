PS101|Yes please I think I will ask her or suggest we meet or something.
PS05X|Yeah by all means by all means.
PS101|I just wonder if she and Cathy might like to come because she did say to me how is Cathy and I said she was.
PS05X|She knows about Cathy's problem.
PS101|Yes she so do you think Cathy would mind if I rang her and I said no I'm sure she wouldn't At the end she left I said do ring Cathy if you feel like it because I'm sure she won't mind well it would be nice for us to find out who's been through the same thing recently.
PS05X|Mm.
