PS05X|How on earth that fellow reckons his pin down regime could have been positive That's the guy isn't it It's extraordinary.
PS101|agree like the way he's standing.
PS05X|Doesn't it just.
PS101|I wouldn't mind children with problems.
PS05X|Yep.
PS101|punishment.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|I hope she didn't find it as easy as she told them if you shut them up in their room.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|There's not a lot they can do is there.
PS05X|No.
PS101|children's right I should think.
PS05X|Mm I agree And I agree they're going to sue him.
PS101|these days Do it for money everything right.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|going to teachers staffed The more you educate your teachers the more they're going towards I'm not saying if there's an argument against educating them.
PS05X|Do you think there is an argument for finding natural teachers as opposed to set of people to get on with the job.
PS101|How would you find them to start with.
PS05X|I don't know.
PS101|You can't you aren't saying that teaching is to is a skill that can't isn't teaching is now a skill in.
PS05X|No I'm not but I'm saying that some people probably have a natural a natural teaching ability.
PS101|But how do you know when you're eighteen whatever is a natural teaching ability or merely a wish to try it.
PS05X|Maybe eighteen is not the right age to be recruiting teachers.
PS101|recruit Well how do you know you're going to be a doctor or anything when you're eighteen then you know you can't you're teaching.
PS05X|No I accept it Accept that.
PS101|I mean it is a longer training now what it used to be standard is required I think you need a lot of knowledge especially nowadays when they're insisting on all this national curriculum you've got to have a very broad ability And then of course you need and you're going to avoid chance like this and or whoever you You've got to be educated in child development and child psychology and the emotional development of children as well as their physical and educational intellectual.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|You've got to have all that side of it and if you're in teaching it's a bit ridiculous to be in any job if you don't know something about the history of it I mean no one's suggesting doctors sit and learn all the theory of and the history of the development of medicine but I'm sure that it's important to have some knowledge of your area.
PS05X|Mm Yes.
PS101|So you wouldn't just push it all out and how do you discuss new educational reforms if you haven't any idea about the original previous.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|reformat I mean you've got to be you knowledgable about your the area in which you work so I don't think you can just wipe out the history of education that's irrelevant.
PS05X|No.
PS101|In fact there's a great argument teaching teachers a lot more about the legal areas these days as a teaching Instead of just relying on your union.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|Knowing your responsibilities and your rights there's a four year you think they'd fit quite a lot into that cos a lot of it is holiday.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|and a lot of it erm teaching Teaching terribly important but I suppose teaching.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|Not just.
PS05X|Yes indeed.
PS101|You know you need to be really helpful when your teachers your class you're put in to responsibility as well as the next college lecturers that'll help you.
PS05X|Yes indeed.
PS101|Which isn't Would you like coffee and biscuits or would you like some fruit or a piece of bread and jam or what do you fancy.
PS05X|I'll have some fruit first please It's quite a lurid apple isn't it.
PS05X|Oh.
PS05X|I didn't get round to ringing Christine last night.
PS101|I couldn't get through to yes her number's still engaged unless it's been reported.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|She might have just had it off the hook yesterday.
PS05X|Come on.
PS101|Students with O A level passes for ninety three percent of training teachers Eight out of ten graduates have a good second class honours degree It's not such a high percentage in maths as it is Twelve and a half thousand early retirements in eighty nine.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|Four thousand retirements through ill health doubles the number to eighty seven.
PS05X|Aha.
PS101|A good honours graduate now has a starting salary of eleven thousand five hundred why should good honours graduate teachers earn fifty percent medical medical practitioner seventy five percent less than new accountants or eighty percent less than new civil engineers.
PS05X|Yes it's not they've turned it into a total university trained job erm people haven't given award.
PS101|Well apparently used to be trained.
PS05X|No taken them they're taken to be professionals though aren't they.
PS101|That would be the theory.
PS05X|Professionally speaking I've never had taken that.
PS101|Educational is not seen as a vital part of national right that must be somebody The wages earned by unskilled workers in Germany are twice as high as those earned by teachers here.
PS05X|likely don't it.
PS101|across the board trouble is when you get these differential spend all the interpretation on them not that you're rewarding the good teachers but that some teachers are not worth rewarding Now if you really are a weak teacher.
PS05X|out.
PS101|Then your then your feelings perhaps don't matter in the overall picture of the education but bearing in looking at the teachers in our school we we really don't have a weak teacher except perhaps Mr who's obviously not been well these last three years erm.
PS05X|He is weak on discipline.
PS101|He is very high in his guild his musical know gets a lot of work from the children and the children really like his classes.
PS05X|So does that mean that he is a good teacher of music he's just not a good disciplinarian.
PS101|To be a teacher you've got to have control of your children and you can't.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|possible however good you are at your subject.
PS05X|Right right.
PS101|You must have control of your class sometimes if you don't under when I say he's a weak teacher I don't mean he's a bad teacher I wouldn't single him out I would just say he's not a strong teacher for the reason that he's only got part of it under his belt properly yet.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|But you know you can't you might say well this teacher doesn't have such good displays on her wall but then she might be ever so good at another area I mean is not a display lady she doesn't have artistic creative sort of flair like say Polly did.
PS05X|Yep.
PS101|but.
PS05X|Well there's nobody in this school has it like Polly did.
PS101|Well Ms's pretty good.
PS05X|Is she.
PS101|And Vicky is very good.
PS05X|Mm yes.
PS101|And Polly always used to say how good Lynn was reckoned she could make a good career in designer living.
PS05X|Oh yeah.
PS101|Erm but Jan is one of the best organizers that I know.
PS05X|Is she.
PS101|She covers She's terribly thorough.
PS05X|Mhm.
PS101|And her children are very very well grounded.
PS05X|Are they Yes.
PS101|You know they they really are And that's a greatest skill in itself.
PS05X|Mm Yes.
PS101|Everybody's got their erm what's her name Jill from New Zealand is quite young but she has all the potential of being an excellent teacher she's she's very enthusiastic very straightforward she's.
PS05X|What'll her experience that she had in New Zealand.
PS101|I think it was Hong Kong she had it.
PS05X|Oh really.
PS101|She had been teaching New Zealand erm not quite such a long training so she's had three or four years' experience.
PS05X|Mhm.
PS101|She was teaching in a private school in this country before she came to us.
PS05X|Was she now Oh she's not still learning then.
PS101|No but she is young all the same.
PS05X|Is she erm.
PS101|But she's a very good keen teacher.
PS05X|Yep.
PS101|But you wouldn't expect her to be as experienced as Maureen.
PS05X|No of course not.
PS101|But in on her level she's a very good teacher.
PS05X|Yeah.
PS101|And brings a different quality to her class.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|And Vicky's very good Vicky's somewhat disorganised really.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|Work in something of a muddle but Vicky has a great eye for detail.
PS05X|Oh.
PS101|With enormous patience as well as huge fund of knowledge and skill she's a very talented girl.
