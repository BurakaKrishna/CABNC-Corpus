PS05X|Most most people play this er with a fairly conventional croquet stroke because the black ball's the blue ball's gon na go twice the distance of the red Isn't it.
PS107|Yes.
PS05X|Roughly.
PS107|Yes.
PS05X|So really just I I always have problems I I always tend to play it down like that I don't know why But most you should really stand up and play it with fairly play together You can't for real you can't really move blue ball you can move the red ball as much as you like but not What you have to do is to so just try a normally conventional just sling straight through here.
PS107|Yeah.
PS05X|You're doing what I was always doing the red the yellow but try it again.
PS107|Yeah it was the red near the yellow you mean Yes.
PS102|Ivan Ivan.
PS103|Okay.
PS05X|You can go now.
PS107|Right.
PS05X|Hang on a bit Try and step it forward.
PS107|Right Yep I was pushing wasn't I.
PS05X|If I still was going down I'd do it like that.
PS107|Lovely Yes.
PS05X|or the blue I mean the red's gone all right But that's what we're trying to do trying.
PS107|Right Okay.
PS05X|play the shot like that way but I think whatever works for you.
