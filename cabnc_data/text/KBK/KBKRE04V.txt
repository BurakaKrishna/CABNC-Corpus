PS05X|I see right.
PS107|When you start is to do a thing put that mallet down like that and then line up the which you need to go.
PS05X|I see.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|The other ball contact must be a contact there.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|Just about enough the red from Now that yellow that blue ball must move.
PS05X|Right.
PS107|otherwise it's fault Now where that centre of that V is where the black ball will go.

PS107|Right now you come out or go up to red I think I would just go up to red.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|till you've got the feel of it I.
PS05X|Right fine.
PS107|And the object is to hit red.
