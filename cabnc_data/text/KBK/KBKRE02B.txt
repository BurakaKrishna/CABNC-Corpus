PS102|Yeah Who's got a posh H reg B M W.
PS05X|Bill next door he's d company d boss of a plastics company Yes I agree He had a perfectly good Audi when he moved here last year so why in the heck does he need a monster B M W like that then.
PS102|Simon actually counting up the cars next door on the drive getting by that knowledge wanted to keep it.
PS102|And eh Simon got all the mud all and he said you know when I was young we were ahead of the but now we're well behind.

PS102|It's because of it that we bought.
PS05X|Yeah Up to you sonny boy I know two or three lads of the next generation beyond us who are doing in their twenties rather better than their fathers in their fifties.
PS102|Yes.
PS102|it's where they put the energy don't they.
PS05X|Most of them in banking or accountancy The thing that about Bill is he does have an amazing amount of labour saving gear like electric hedge shears trimmers and erm.
PS102|Graham's got that.
PS05X|He he he's got erm a pump for the erm hosepipe so that when he hoses the front or the car he's really got a spurt yes yes he actually put's the hose in one side and goes sh shoots it out again.
PS102|long enough.
PS05X|Well if you're gon na get the bottom of the garden where you're downhill it's not too bad but when you're coming up here and doing as he was watering the new grass on the front he he I mean yes he is below it it's the bottom of your storage tank in c in the attic which counts.
PS102|Doesn't your outside tap come off of me Cos I'm.
PS05X|Yes oh you may be right there Lynda you may be right.
PS102|I thought.
PS05X|Now we don't have huge we we we've turned down our thing so that we don't get the kitchen sink which is also off the mains brrrr splattering everywhere so that could explain why mine isn't as good as it could be yes you're right.
PS102|actually quite strong and I use the hose to rinse I hose my car on Monday.
PS05X|Yes yes I.
PS102|I've never done that before and I got drowned.
PS05X|I assume you're right Lynda but quite frankly I don't know.
PS102|I think Graham's got a lot things like that we've got electric hedge trimmer those electric erm chainsaw and rotavator.
PS05X|Mhm.
PS102|and all things like that for the garden we've got a lot of I think the only thing that we really is a crunch-you-upper.
PS05X|Oh really.
PS102|whatever they're called.
PS05X|Yes yes treader.
PS102|I think he would actually.
PS05X|Yes.
PS05X|Did you come to any conclusion you looked at the Which Board on that didn't you.
PS102|Yeah I came to the conclusion I couldn't afford any of it.
PS05X|Ah I thought perhaps you you anticipated a husband without an arm or something.
PS102|No that consideration I think you know if he didn't kill himself with a chainsaw he'd probably be alright with the shredder.
PS102|I really thought we was going to end with erm cos he was sitting right at the top branch you know sawing merrily through.
PS05X|With with an electric mains electric.
PS05X|Oh my god.
PS05X|Ooh.
PS102|And we've got a circuit breaker touch and go.
PS05X|Yes yes.
PS05X|Thank god he's got a circuit breaker.
PS102|And I quite expected to erm to one of the branches to bend quite a height.
PS05X|Mm.
PS102|And the chainsaw's very heavy.
PS05X|Yes.
