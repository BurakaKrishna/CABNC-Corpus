PS05X|I've never seen such dry grapefruit.
PS101|I ought to complain really It's such such a time wasting procedure when you've got to take things back.
PS05X|Where did they come from.
PS101|Sainsbury's.
PS05X|Mm.
PS101|It's the same sort we had before that have been so good And the last couple of weeks I bought the cheaper ones.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|And that was forty eight pence for one grapefruit because it was pink.
PS05X|Doesn't even look pink does it.
PS101|No.
PS05X|Well I think you complain I don't think you have to take it back I didn't take that chicken back to Safeway's if you remember.
PS101|What chicken was that.
PS05X|The one that smelt.
PS101|Did you complain.
PS05X|Yes Don't you remember that.
PS101|I remember the chicken But I don't remember.
PS05X|Some months ago I took the label back Didn't take didn't bother with the chicken And she didn't she scarcely even looked at the label She took my word for it Unfortunately because it it was a special sell today job with a reduction off others I didn't get much money back And then went and bought another fresh chicken had to pay even more money for it Ah Well it's incredible how little mail and there's nothing on fax or telex either.
PS101|They're all on holiday perhaps half term.
PS05X|This is not nice.
PS101|Looks revolting.
PS05X|Mm Well.
PS101|Well don't bother we'll take it back.
PS05X|Really not good Extraordinary Will you have toast Cake Sorry will you have some toast.
