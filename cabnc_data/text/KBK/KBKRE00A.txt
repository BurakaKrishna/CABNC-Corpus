PS05X|Have you tried them on already.
PS101|Not yet.
PS05X|I like the look of it very much.
PS101|Oh.
PS05X|or something.
PS101|No.
PS05X|Fits nicer than that one Do you like it.
PS101|Well I'm asking you.
PS05X|Yes I like it I like it.
PS101|Well you think it fits alright.
PS05X|It seems to me to fit perfectly.
PS101|And the colour's not too drab.
PS05X|I don't think the colour's drab at all I think the colour's fab.
PS101|Right.
PS05X|Looks just fine to me.
PS101|Yes Mm I'll just slip on another one.
PS05X|I like it.
PS101|It wasn't too expensive Thirty pounds twenty-nine ninety five or something.
PS05X|Good.
PS101|Which isn't a bad price.
PS05X|Did you try do you try any of them on in Marks.
PS101|No.
PS05X|What's the material like.
PS101|I don't know Now this one I've realized now is actually meant for wearing outside because it's got a bit of shaping here see.
PS05X|Oh I see what you mean yes yes.
PS101|Erm but whether that couldn't wear it outside with this.
PS05X|Out out out or in presumably.
PS101|Presumably.
PS05X|What do you mean.
PS101|The collar ends in a point at the bottom in the styling.
PS05X|Oh I see Oh yes yes yes yes I do see what you mean yeah.
PS101|I will say it's cut shorter at the back.
PS05X|sort of waistcoaty in fact.
PS05X|Well it looks fine tucked in like that.
PS101|I mean there's not much of it to tuck in You know sort of.
PS05X|Well that looks very smart as it is.
PS101|But you couldn't wear it out on this particular blouse.
PS05X|Well ca w.
PS101|because of the belt If you wore the erm.
PS05X|Well try it.
PS101|If you I will You think that the colours go and.
PS05X|I think the colours go very well indeed I mean it doesn't pick up precisely the same colour but that in there.
PS05X|Yes it is Yes it is Yes But it clashes very well indeed Why can't you wear it out like that.
PS101|Because you destroy the blouse the the way that the belt.
PS05X|Well that doesn't matter if you've got your if you've got your jack your jackety effect then haven't you.
PS101|I suppose you could if you were going to wear it like that you could take the belt right off.
PS05X|Well you don't have to.
PS101|Well no but you it it it's quite a heavy belt and if it if it's holding if it's giving point to it.
PS05X|Yes And that would make it a an even cooler outfit wouldn't it.
PS101|Yes Because I have got this this this creamy shirt Erm which I saw again in Marks this year which you could wear tucked in with a belt.
PS05X|Yes Yes But that one is is genuinely versatile Looks just as good tucked in as.
PS101|Yes As I say the problem with the tucking in on that one is there's not quite such a lot of length So when you do this you might come out.
PS05X|It'd start pulling out yes.
PS101|Erm and I don't think it looks good hanging out because it's you you paying in the skirt and the belt and that And it's a bit silly to wear er a permanent arrangement But this shirt could be worn with the skirt couldn't it.
PS05X|Definitely.
PS101|I mean the colour's just as it's not quite as strong.
PS05X|the colour's pretty neutral isn't it.
PS101|But I mean it does pick up.
PS05X|Yes Yes I think the skirt's gon na be very useful actually.
PS101|Er good skirt whether.
PS05X|Well I hope you will I like it.
PS05X|It's the wrong green I think The actual skirt the skirt's a blueyer green But you've got two blouses to wear with it that's alright You've got this other white one as well.
PS101|white one That's a short that's your shirt.
PS05X|That's mine is it Mm.
PS101|They're very good that's the white one.
PS05X|Yes I would have thought.
PS101|This white one might the cream one.
PS05X|Well so you've got four blouses.
PS101|Which is the fourth.
PS05X|Well the one you just said is a bit old now.
PS101|Oh yeah but that's white again isn't it.
PS05X|Yes No I think they're all worth and I think that's an attractive top as well I think you should have that.
PS101|Well erm What else.
PS05X|I don't know It's it's it's a possible winter or cooler.
PS101|No it's not.
PS05X|weather skirt With a jumper or cardigan.
PS101|No it's not cooler warmer weather and it's got short sleeves you know I don't really erm.
PS101|That's wrong for that This has got a stain on it.
PS05X|That's a nuisance It would be perfectly acceptable otherwise.
PS101|Yes and we've got big crease marks on there.
PS05X|Let's have a look.
PS101|There I know it's there I know it was last year I was really annoyed.
PS05X|Put the light on Well if we can't see it it doesn't matter even if it is thereN'est pas.
PS101|Well you certainly can't see it Which is cos there was this big round grease mark It was very but maybe I got it out But I suppose that might erm.
PS05X|Don't you think they go well together.
PS101|work Those colours are not too dark are they.
PS101|They're not perfect but they would do Oh what about this Mind you this skirt is only casual And that's a rather sort of formal blouse No that's wrong wrong.
PS05X|Oddly enough I mean it's so far away from the yellow I would say it isn't wrong.
PS101|Oh it is wrong It's not it's not the same as this at all That's sort of brilliant.
PS05X|That that's a hot pattern and colour isn't it.
PS101|That's a brilliant yellow yes And this one's erm a sort of golder And that wouldn't do But that's colours go with that.
PS05X|Mhm.
PS101|Those are the only And I'll keep this blue skirt stain quite smart.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|And I'll keep the dress And I'll think about the shirt I like it with the skirt What I might do is go back to Marks If they have one thing in that colour they may have another one.
PS05X|In what colour We were chatting.
PS101|The gold.
PS05X|Are you are you thinking of that because it's a bit too formal or something.
PS101|No just because it hasn't got the length for tucking in.
PS05X|Oh yes.
PS101|And I don't like these that pull out when you.
PS05X|Well at least if it pulls out it looks alright It was interesting in the pub last night There were quite a lot of enthusiastic er audience but er they were mostly grey beards like me Yes Oh yes well apparently they normally have a sort of rhythm and blues or something on a on a Thursday Er or soul or something of that sort which er you know there were loads of youngsters in the pub Not under age youngsters I was pleased to see But er there were a goodly proportion of people who were really enjoying the er the track.
PS101|I'm sorry I didn't feel up to going.
PS05X|Yeah Well we've got plenty of other I've got the list opportunities to go and hear them again He's a funny character though.
PS101|Who Who's a funny character.

PS05X|Oh who runs the band sorry runs the band.
PS101|Oh who runs the band.
PS05X|Yeah it it's a new interim landlord at the Crown.
PS101|What happened to the old one.
PS05X|Oh they move on Erm you know he found another pub Sometimes they move from being managers to being licence erm erm tenants I mean.
PS05X|when they're running their own business.
PS101|A bigger pub.
PS05X|Perhaps but I mean the Crown is quite a big pub.
PS101|more opportunities.
PS05X|Quite a big pub It's a with its own kitchens and what have you I should think you could make a good living there if you wanted to And there have been long term er landlords there.
PS05X|Sorry.
PS05X|Mm Well I'll go and shower now Snoopy was off in a rush wasn't she.
PS101|Well she was going on the train.
PS05X|Didn't realize she was going quite so early but I suppose it's hardly early anyway now.

PS101|Veronica doesn't want want to do the shopping bit of it.
PS05X|No.
PS101|I don't blame her either.
PS05X|yes it's certainly improving a bit.
PS101|I know she hasn't left all her customers.
PS05X|Oh quite quite Does she have any other suggestions of shops for the linings.
PS101|Well John Lewis probably will have it but that means burdening Suzannah with it At a time when she's busy with her exams It also means sorting out the cash.
PS05X|How interested is she in the preparation of this dress.
PS101|Oh she's interested alright.
PS05X|Interested enough to be enthusiastic and do the right thing.
PS101|Well she she also.
PS05X|Did she.
PS101|but she is preoccupied at the moment with her exams and in a way I'm glad I didn't want to send her material hunting if she could be doing something useful at college.
PS05X|Yes yes fair enough Anyway O K.
PS101|Karen's given her an extra job from.
PS05X|Is she.
PS101|going in on Monday when she doesn't normally.

PS05X|Homeopathic ones.
PS101|Well that's the kind I was after Erm I mentioned it to Suzannah And she wasn't averse to the idea But she said she doesn't need them for Monday because it's only when she takes the tests she gets in a panic not when she's she said she can do it in the practice classes.
PS05X|Right.
PS101|What she needs lots of practice with different not all on one man like before.
PS05X|Yes.
