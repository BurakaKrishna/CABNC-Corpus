PS05X|What does it actually prove osmosis or diffusion.
PS101|Osmosis.
PS05X|Pardon.
PS101|I think it's osmosis.
PS05X|Ah that's the passing of a erm er erm something no it can't be osmosis cos it's a part of membrane Passing of a liquid.
PS101|No diffusion.
PS05X|liquid no diffusion can anywhere doesn't have to pass membrane at all Passing of a liquid through a membrane leaving part of it's substance behind.
PS103|It's something to.
PS101|It's absolutely nothing.
PS103|Osmosis is the passing of water from a place of high water density to place of low water density.
PS05X|Boom boom super.
PS101|Is that right.
PS05X|Yes what does that mean in practice Snoopy.
PS103|Don't know.
PS101|Where does osmosis occur dad means.

PS103|Yeah.
PS101|Drink you can't see it if you put them in water you just know the water's gone but it might of evaporated I just make them see the colour going up the stem of a plant You can do it with a turn the carnation pink or you know it's white that sort of thing I was just having a little experiment to see how it takes and how strong it is and I know what I'm doing.
PS05X|Well I can't see that that would actually prevent action.
PS101|Well that's all it is.
PS05X|Is it Oh.
PS101|Try to prove anything is so the water travels up the plant I can't think of anything.
PS05X|You haven't got a plant there have you.
PS101|A theory is a plant what else does it do.
PS05X|No not when it's chopped off top and bottom like a stick from the fridge dear it's not a plant.
PS101|It is a plant.
