PS05X|It looks as if over there stuck on the wall they've got a rechargeable for hoover for taking crumbs off the tables.
PS05X|Well as it's used in other muckier places I tend not to use it over cleaning table white cloths aah.
PS101|I'm very well fed.
PS05X|I'm very well fed too I think I shall ask them for the bill.
PS05X|Yes I did to clobber in Black Heath village I notice it didn't say that the premises are now called the age centre.
PS101|No today you see a lot of people wearing large earrings don't you.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|Is that why you wear such small ones.
PS05X|As so claims that was a rather naff comment actually I can't imagine that well I can imagine other people wearing big earrings because they're super confident.
PS101|Then you obviously had a you did say such a lot of in the Radio Times somewhere I was reading today about er colours you wear.
PS05X|Oh yes.
PS101|And how people who wear red go in in business situations go in to assert power you know I mean.
PS05X|You do mean women in red suits presumably not men in red ties.
PS101|No men in red ties as well.
PS05X|Oh really.
PS101|Yes When I put on red one day I mean I don't think I have anything in red do I but when I put on my clothes in the morning.
PS102|Would you like some more coffee.
PS05X|No thank yo would you like some more coffee.
PS101|No thank you.
PS05X|Could we have the bill please.
PS102|Yes.
PS101|Erm I'm influenced by all kinds of things but I'm sure I'm not influenced by wishing for certain power or not.
PS05X|You don't need to.
PS101|No but I mean there are other such reasons I mean there may be initially choosing clothes or something like that but when I put them on in the morning I usually put them on to suit the weather and what's clean and what I've got tights to match.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|Which shoes are comfortable today.
PS05X|Mhm.
PS101|Or clean today.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|Whether I've got painting on them.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|Erm what I wore yesterday and the day before and also practical things like that.
PS05X|Yep.
PS101|I think you need a lot of room for.
PS05X|Very true.
PS101|Whether its going to influence me or not.
