PS107|Eh you can see where the was there.
PS05X|Yep.
PS107|Probably somewhere round here must be.
PS05X|Other side.
PS107|Got to be this side.
PS05X|Right Fine.
PS107|Not a very accurate.
PS05X|No.
PS107|One of the problems was really was.
PS05X|Yes.
PS05X|Yep.
PS107|I've already so I've had it.
PS05X|Oh bad luck.
PS107|Yes.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|So I've well what I can do is go down there Unfortunately that's right in the way I've got a continuation shot well what I shall do is just try and line them up for a rush down to which is not bad.
PS05X|No Fine.
PS107|O K.
PS05X|O K.
PS107|I think probably that red.
PS05X|Yes back down here again.
PS05X|Yes I have yes.
PS107|Erm take.
PS05X|Right.
PS05X|But it's still best to remove the temptation here.
PS107|Yeah it would.
PS05X|Right right.
PS107|down here.
PS05X|Right O K.
PS05X|Right.
PS107|So what what most people do is when they bring the mallets back they tend to twist them.
PS05X|Aha Yes.
PS107|It's easy when you're pushing forward to keep it straight it's when you bring it back it tends to twist.
PS05X|Surely.
PS107|So try and concentrate on bringing it back and then bring I mean you can bring it back fairly slowly.
PS05X|Alright oh fine yes.
PS107|Very good it's nice to see you hitting a ball like that.
PS05X|Yes it felt good too.
PS107|Yes.
PS05X|You could actually feel it working well.

PS05X|O K I should yes.
PS107|Erm you can always stop and ask.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|The trouble is you can make there's a lot of people it's very easy when you're concentrating on what you're going to do next you forget the colour you're playing.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|Especially when you're making a break so having made the.
PS05X|Right.
PS107|So you know you're playing with red.
PS05X|I see yes.
PS107|Cos don't forget you're playing with two balls.
PS05X|Quite.
PS05X|Right.
PS107|Eh the danger is if you don't then break down if you leave my blue near the er black break down then I'm just going to get back in.
PS05X|Yes yes.
PS107|So with if a very difficult shot what what I'll do is just Let's just do a.
PS05X|To to not necessarily to hit the black but to.
