PS05X|Well John was saying to me that eh Bill is such a perfectionist that although he's done good works already he will ensure that every single corner of that house will be immaculate and exactly the way he wants it but it'll take him three or four years to do it.
PS101|Oh I think it took us about seven years to get every room in our house.
