PS102|Ninety pounds.
PS05X|Remember that you've got some fairly chunky stuff here you've got some pieces which weigh an awful lot where's the.
PS102|You'd you'd think the.
PS05X|I'm talking by ton yeah.
PS102|Yeah but what difference do you do you think there might be a premium to pay for.
PS05X|Heavy chunks er there's no way you're going to get some of this stuff into big big boxes erm and I mean some of it there's one piece here eight point nine metres long Nine point six metres long it's heavy and it's awkward Seven two fifty millimetres long six point eight metres long and when it's seven point two five metres by three point eight five metres that's sixteen feet by thirty two feet ehm and it's thirteen millimetres thick it ain't half gon na weigh.
