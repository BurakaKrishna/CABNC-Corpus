PS107|Slightly off centre Because of the danger of that ball jumping you hit over the top like that it'll jump.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|You you take up the normal I don't tend to do this but this is really the best way to do the shot.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|Take up your normal start and then just tap the back a little bit cos you're hitting that ball on the upward swing then and there's no danger that you're gon na jump over it See if you'll try and get it to jump if you.
PS05X|Yes yes yep.
PS107|Very very easy to get the finger on the.
PS05X|Fine.
PS107|Erm bumpy lawns jump that over ball.
PS05X|Right So step back and hit hit it on the up stroke.
PS107|Yeah and try and ground the mallet a little bit cos then the black ball will go quite nicely down there.
PS05X|Oh right fine.
