PS05X|Well that's what counts isn't it.

PS05X|So I'm now going straight for the black.
PS107|Oh no You can move the yellow can't you.
PS05X|Oh yes Yes I see.
PS107|What I would do because you haven't got a blue hard enough is to push yellow off somewhere to the left of black.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|so you can only push it across to three and get near the yellow near the black.
PS05X|Right.
PS107|You must you must get at least a ball a pioneer ball near your next two.
PS05X|Right.
PS107|to stand a chance.
