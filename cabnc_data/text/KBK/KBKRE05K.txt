PS107|If you kind of drop down behind the blue if you use the blue first and the bat's up there you got ta go sort of near to it to get behind you're going to rush down to your hoop Now you've got a much easier shot haven't you.
PS05X|Yes.
PS107|You can just push blue back over there and and or if you are not happy about that just a little take up Bearing in mind that a take up is always a much more accurate shot specially for beginners It's just a little tiny tap and you're gon na.
PS05X|That's it.
PS107|get right about there aren't you.
PS05X|Yep Fine.
