PS102|Doesn't it make you feel funny to have.
PS101|Erm therefore it doesn't really I mean therefore she doesn't pass So there is some judgement and skill involved And I think her judgement is impaired by the fact she feels nervous And is anxious not to overdo it and cos that's another where you fail again.
PS102|Yes unless somebody.
PS101|bad enough But he wouldn't be letting you use your time if you were that poor at it because they do build you up very slowly over two years she's been doing it.
PS05X|Well.
PS101|Well hopefully she's got another class on Monday She likes her tutor.
PS102|Well I'd be happy to give you the name of the particular one but I don't know whether it applies to the young they usually want to know the colour of your eyes and that sort of thing.
PS101|Well I only I've bought odd things in the past and never actually been asked anything specific.
PS102|I'll ask June It may not apply to anything but I know in the past when she's given me those things to try erm she's got a book at home and it'll say erm particular.
PS102|a decent homeopathic shop they prescribe.
PS102|She she uses homeopathic treatment She went to the er College of Veterinary Surgeons yest Wednesday with her latest dog because she's not jumping You know she just got bigger dog And she's had it some time now but the whole purpose was to so that she could train this one because the first one now is too old the second one has and can't And the second was a sort of The third one has hip displacement The fourth one and Jim wanted one And she's had hip displacement.
PS101|Again.
PS102|Yes So she can't so she has five dogs she can't train.
PS05X|Good god.
PS102|And she tablet today But that will be a bit of a.
PS05X|I hope it means she doesn't buy any more dogs I I fear the opposite.
PS102|Well the one thing she can't do now is breed from her So she has to have her spayed I didn't know she planned to breed from her but er she must But it means she has five dogs to look after and.
PS101|Has she not passed dogs on or They're more like children than dogs.
PS102|Oh yes Yes more like more like children than children to her actually Erm the only thing that occurred to me I just wondered if she knew somebody who had a dearly loved dog that didn't want to train it but you know she could perhaps just take along for the joy of running it and training it but I think part of the pleasure is the reflected glory you know it's my dog.
PS101|Well it's.
PS102|Yes So I don't.
PS101|Our erm department head at school has a beautiful collie And they felt he was bored at home because they're out quite a lot.
PS102|Mm.
PS101|and although he's well trained and they exercise him They felt he was bored so they took him to training classes and Tricia said he's an absolute natural He goes up through the hoops along the narrow she said the first day when all the others were standing there shaking at the narrow bath he was just over it and down and she said you've never seen him.
PS102|I mean they do it and thoroughly enjoy it All of them do that er.
PS101|They're not showing theirs or using it for any other purpose just for the dog's benefit.
PS102|Yes For enjoyment.
PS102|She doesn't show them as such it's all agility and er obediency and so on And the dogs do they wouldn't do it otherwise I suppose.
PS05X|Good afternoon good morning I mean.
PS05X|Pretty order Phone call from Singapore Do you want to keep that list of the jazz.
PS102|Yes.
PS05X|because I've got the similar similar thing in small format here.
PS102|I was just trying to remember whether they did Joan's do at the last year But I've got a feeling they didn't No they they didn't because the that's right because it was cancelled last year it was the year before she did But I thought they were perfectly acceptable and surprised in a way that so many people commented adversely on them Because they don't make a bad noise.
PS05X|I think it's people who don't like trad jazz Lynda.
PS102|That's right.
PS05X|I think that's all all you can say.
PS102|Erm we are there should be another order from Descar ready today.
PS05X|Oh.
PS102|Mm One.
PS05X|Are you going to ring.
PS102|I just.
PS05X|Yes.
PS102|Erm The other thing I'm wondering whether I should do the Petroline order which in fact flew on its first leg to Rome yesterday.
PS05X|Yes.
PS102|It's only worth about a hundred pounds We haven't insured it at all yet erm arrange that anyway.
PS05X|Mm.
PS102|But might not be the best thing because if for any reason the buyer says that they didn't they're not going to pay.
PS05X|I I I think we've got to accept that that on that business we have we have do not have secure terms period.
PS102|Right but should we insure it fully.
PS05X|Not fully But contingency.
PS102|Contingency is I thought was just sort of between here and the airport.
PS05X|Oh no.
PS102|until it left the country.
PS05X|No No no no.
PS05X|That is what it is for That is what it is Contingency is if the customer having the buyer having said he will cover the insurance doesn't.
PS102|Mm.
PS05X|and then doesn't get his money doesn't pay us.
PS102|Right.
PS05X|we can claim.
PS102|But if it was lost we could still claim We could claim he couldn't but we could.
PS05X|Yes.
PS102|Fine O K.
PS05X|Yes We will probably have to prove that we have not been paid for the consignment.
PS102|Interesting.
PS05X|Interesting possibility But it it it's not covering from factory to airport or anything of that sort It is definitely covering.
PS102|Right covering part of the risk.
PS05X|Yes.
PS102|But not the.
PS05X|Yes Because we we can only take it on their word when they say we shall insure I mean we should be doing it for shouldn't we.
PS102|I do do it for.
PS05X|Do you Right O K Ah.
PS102|contingency only.
PS05X|I suppose it it doesn't matter very much one way or the other does it.
PS102|What to them cheaper.
PS05X|Cheaper to us erm the trouble with it is of course we never actually add it in Do we.
PS102|Yes costs I do.
PS05X|Do you.
PS102|Oh yes.
PS05X|You you bung it across to the customer.
PS102|Ah I do if it's a C I N contract when I'm.
PS05X|Well if it's a C I N contract you aren't you're not contingency.
PS102|No If it's contingency no I don't.
PS05X|No.
PS102|But it's usually.
PS05X|It is a small sum yes that's quite true Great.
PS102|I do add it into the costs if it's.
PS05X|Ah Yes.
PS102|don't know do they.
PS05X|No that's true That's quite true Now er Richard rang me at fiveo'clock yesterday.
PS102|That's an old fashioned half an hour.
PS05X|Yes He did say that he'd tried to ring before I got back from lunch but I'm not one hundred percent certain Erm but it wasn't it was twenty past two when I got back from lunch Erm and the erm I saw John at lunchtime and I mentioned it to him because he he said that it hadn't even occurred to me till then because he said I'm concentrating on the surveying side and I thought ha ha ha to you my friend Would you like Richard's work telephone number.
PS102|why not Did you discover what company he works for.
PS05X|No I didn't I'm afraid.
PS102|Oh.
PS05X|No I didn't erm I didn't ask But he said er and I said that I gather you're seeing Lynda the weekend if you do find anything perhaps you could pass it on to her And John said oh it will give me something to do It is a bit desperate isn't it.
PS05X|I think Lewisham have got themselves into a ludicrous state over people er Erm being pushed sideways into jobs that don't match and being paid full price I don't want Erm being paid their full salary Yeah we don't want you any more so go and go and twiddle your thumbs in this corner but they're still paying them twenty thousand a year Absolute farce Absolutely farcical.
PS102|But I thought John had been put into a job that in fact he was born to and getting his teeth into.
PS05X|Absolutely Absolutely but he's up against the fact that nobody wants to know what he's doing Quality control I mean er client satisfaction things of that sort I'm not quite sure what he's into But er being a local authority they're saying oh come on Why make the effort.
PS102|I mean sadly that really was in a sense what making local authorities answerable was supposed to stamp out.
PS05X|Yes And of course local government is the most wonderful procrastinator in the world isn't it.
PS102|Yes but if they truly were answerable for their own budgets.
PS05X|Oh sure.
PS102|which they're still not.
PS05X|No.
PS102|and you know never will be now.
PS05X|That's right That's absolutely right.
PS102|er that things go on like that.
PS05X|That's right And that's going to be.
PS102|But who does it benefit It doesn't benefit I was quite convinced that ninety nine percent of people do not actually enjoy sitting doing nothing You like to feel useful.
PS05X|Oh absolutely.
PS102|But who does that benefit apart from the fact they're getting a salary at the end of the day.
PS05X|Nobody Nobody Nobody But but when initially presented to you here's twenty thousand a year for doing nothing my friend It's it has an element of appeal doesn't it.
PS102|Well clearly you'd rather being doing that than doing.
PS05X|Getting nothing for doing nothing.
PS102|Yes Yes But why can't they get their act together and.
PS05X|Yes Yes I agree.
PS102|I suppose at the end of the day yes you're right He's as well sit pushing papers around pretending to be busy but drawing the salary than being made redundant which is what ought to be happening.
PS05X|Yes.
PS102|But they could possibly they surely must be able to do it through natural wastage to some extent.
PS05X|I would have thought so.
PS102|I mean all the time.
PS05X|This Guys er business incidentally They're now saying four hundred jobs will go but less than a hundred will be made redundant The other three hundred will go through natural wastage.
PS102|They said six.
PS05X|They said six hundred originally apparently but then and now they're talking four hundred There was some rather naff comments about the union people cohse I mean what a shower Erm On television last night there was some waffling about nothing and complaining they hadn't been told.
PS102|I don't I honestly don't know what the answer is with the National Health but it's going to take years and years and years But probably we'll always.
PS05X|I think the Guys situation is a very interesting experiment It's a shame it's going on under a microscope spotlight or whatever but erm Spotlight I mean don't a microscope Erm but even so it's er it's it's interesting And Guys needs it for goodness sake Guys definitely needs it.
PS102|If you look at all the nationalized industries that have been privatized they're all making thumping great profits now I wouldn't say it was like the Gas Board like B T And I wouldn't say that we were being fleeced I mean I I think we've always been fleeced up to a certain point but they were always making a loss in the past and.
PS05X|Well their their accounting was in commercial terms Lynda It it really was different accounting which is hardly comparable Erm and I see nothing wrong with making decent profits as long as you're not actually ripping people off as a monopoly.
PS102|Yes I think it's a bit dubious what they do with the profits after.
PS05X|Well Oh that that's a different matter That is a surely.
PS102|I mean with something like British Gas erm to make the enormous profit they've made surely it must be possible to reduce the price to the consumer.
PS05X|I would have thought so yes.
PS102|And they can give you all sorts of reasons why.
PS05X|Erm I I I must say I haven't read or heard anything about the British Gas thing.
PS102|billion.
PS05X|Oh yes I knew they'd made a lot of money But erm what they were going to do I don't know.
PS102|justify why they're not going to reduce the price.
PS05X|But the South West Water Authority or whatever they're called erm also made a big profit didn't they But the guy said well ninety percent of this has got to be spent on a small proportion of the works which we are required to do over the next decade.
PS102|Well that's fine You know if British Gas training themselves more efficient or whatever else it is fine.
PS05X|Yes Yes Yes it's when you see British Telecom repainting all their vans with this silly new logo that you get a bit twitchy don't you.
PS05X|Mm.
PS102|I think the health length of waiting lists for operations and the furore about the fact that you've got to ring up and find where the shortest list is and all that.
PS05X|Mm.
PS102|which is a sensible thing to do in a way Lots of people say well I don't mind waiting or whatever.
PS05X|Well Norman on his wall has a a a list of er theoretical waitings for the different specialists at Orpington hospital and presumably he's got one beside it for Queen Mary's as well.
PS102|Mm.
PS05X|So he can actually look at and say oh well Queen Mary's is the place for you to go my friend.
PS102|And some people might say oh I don't want to go there I'd rather wait.
PS05X|That's right Absolutely.
PS102|You know it's going to work out.
PS05X|So it it's happening already.
PS102|Yes.
PS05X|To some degree.
PS102|But er they're never going to I don't think they're ever going to get on top of the waiting lists because they're introducing so many new operations.
PS05X|That's right Yes.
PS102|So And there are people living longer and needing them But it's always going to.
PS05X|You you have got to have a waiting list to use the facilities reasonably fully.
PS102|Yes otherwise you'd have sort of hanging around and asking.
PS05X|That's right.
PS102|how is that hip.
PS05X|Yeah.
PS102|Shall we do it now Right I'll ring.
PS05X|There's your jazz band leader.
PS102|Jeffrey Jeffrey Is that really.
PS05X|That's his full time job.
PS102|when does And he lives in.
PS05X|He admits that it's a area He's a bit of an odd boy himself though you know.
PS102|Yes.
PS05X|And I think it was his wife there last night too Erm and she she's a a curious lady I think it was his wife anyway she went round with a pot at the end.
PS102|And he I mean that's such an anomaly He's effectively a surveyor.
PS05X|Yes He's a building surveyor.
PS102|I mean you know building surveyors don't wear clothes like that pants.
PS05X|Dressed all in black dear.
PS102|I was just gobsmacked.
PS05X|Yes yes Incredible isn't it Brave fellow I'd say.
PS102|Yes I love the humorous name though.
PS05X|Yes it fits him rather well doesn't it.
PS102|Like the little terrace house called Bedlam at the end of.
PS05X|Talking of which there's a house down lower Camden which has the Chislehurst station sign Great big thing Stuck in their driveway It's been there for ages and ages and ages.
PS102|Not a very clever thief really.
PS05X|No I wouldn't have thought so either Enormous great thing.
PS05X|By the way.
PS102|I heard it on erm Capital Radio Now how does it actually work.
PS05X|You just say please may I have my Argos card You take the card back next time and they put it in a machine and add more points to it Recorded electronically.
PS102|And and where do you how do you know how many points you've got.
PS05X|You you don't The machine will no doubt tell you but erm and for every fifty pounds of petrol you get one pound for Argos.
PS102|Oh well that's not bad.
PS05X|Well considering I put thirty quid in to fill the tank yesterday You you get there quite quickly.
PS102|Yes Mine takes thirteen pounds worth at a time such a nuisance.
PS05X|And then you can just shove in your pass and erm.
PS102|So they they put this through the machine.
PS05X|They just put it in the machine and tag it and price.
PS102|And then when you go to Argos they put this through their machine.
PS05X|That's right and read it off.
PS102|Right So anyone can use it.
PS05X|And it's a long term promotion It's going till the end of next year or or August next year.
PS102|Is it just.
PS05X|Yes So you you you have a chance to actually build up something worthwhile.
PS102|Yes I think that's I think that's the first sensible thing they've done worth a pound off so they give you ten points do they every.
PS05X|Well my thirty pounds seventy gave me sixty thirty pence or something What what did I say fifty fifty.
PS102|You said fifty pounds.
PS05X|Fifty pounds worth of petrol gives you one pound off.
PS102|Next up to Which is five pounds off So presumably you have to do it.
PS05X|Do what.
PS102|Well it says you can collect up to twenty five hundred premium points on your collecting card.
PS05X|Then you get another card.
PS102|Then you get another card.
PS05X|You've got stacks of cards there.
PS102|I think that's a jolly good idea.
PS05X|Yes I think it's fair.
PS102|And what I really need is another card for my purse When I was in Sainsbury's yesterday you know credit card pay by cheque And erm I mean I've got.
PS05X|Membership etcetera.
PS102|Yes.
PS05X|National Trust I see there Which you never use.
PS102|I've never used Peugeot warrantee.
PS05X|Oh fancy putting that on a plastic card.
PS102|Well that's no it's a breakdown service.
PS05X|Oh is it.
PS102|Mm Erm my library ticket Er picture of Kate Two tickets for the thirteenth of June And erm stamps worth fifteen pence each which.
PS102|which I can't live without But these are my credit cards.
PS05X|Oh my god.
PS102|What I really need is another credit card I mean yesterday I can never find my Visa card quickly you know what it's like And I found my Mastercard first.
PS05X|Yes.
PS102|and went to put it back and I thought oh doesn't matter does it you know credit cards Gave it to the girl and she went oh erm what's the credit limit on this I said I haven't a clue I've never used it She said oh I've got to write down a credit limit.
PS05X|So Oh what's the credit limit on your Barclaycard.
PS102|I think fifty pounds you know before they have to no it isn't my credit limit.
PS05X|Well yeah well they mean that credit limit.
PS102|It's a thousand pounds.
PS05X|Do you mean as a cheque backing card.
PS102|She said what is your credit limit on this I don't know.
PS05X|Were you paying by cheque.
PS102|Yes.
PS05X|Well it's not a cheque guarantee card anyway That's not a cheque guarantee card Is it.
PS102|Neither is Barclaycard.
PS05X|It is with Barclays but I mean the there's got to be a standard figure for the Barclaycard Any any anybody else's my bank card has a figure on it It actually has fifty quid on it or something of that sort.
PS102|I think it's fifty pounds for everything.
PS05X|Yes.
PS102|Yes anyway So that had to go back and I had to find my Visa card much to the annoyance of people queuing behind me.
