PS101|But erm Liz is getting hassle from her insurance company about her claim on her new door.
PS05X|Oh yes.
PS101|No what happened.
PS05X|No I don't remember your telling me.
PS101|When Suzannah went down there from last she was strap strapping Layla into the back seat.
PS05X|Mhm.
PS101|for Liz while Liz went into the house to get something and someone came down Hurst Road misjudged it and scrapped the car door bashed Lizzie's side and scraped along side of her car as she drove past.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|And it meant a respray on her car and a new door for Lizzie's car sit down.
PS05X|Right.
PS101|And Jim said she was going far too fast took up all three car lengths parked cars to stop.
PS05X|Phew.
PS101|And and obviously she was going to.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|And happened opened the door any wider cos she was still strapping the child in Of which she had been doing as Liz left the car.
PS05X|Yes Was Suzannah hurt.
PS101|No she wasn't only the car door.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|But now Lizzie's insurance company have said they'll do what they can for her but as she had opened the door into the oncoming traffic probably was her fault.
PS05X|And this took place in Hurst Road I mean.
PS101|Yes.
PS05X|tha that's a bit of a nonsense to my mind.
PS101|Well exactly I mean there's double parking in a single line and the lady weary.
PS05X|You can't move at more than about fifteen miles an hour maximum down Hurst Road anyway can you.
PS101|Anyway Liz is a bit annoyed because she doesn't want to lose her no claims bonus.
PS05X|Absolutely Absolutely right yes.
PS101|And I feel in a way slightly responsible that it was Suzannah.
PS05X|Well I don't suppose Suzannah was doing anything she shouldn't have been.
PS101|No she wasn't but even so you know I said that to Liz Liz said oh it's not it's nothing to do with your responsibility E even so she has to pay the first something or other you as one does in a claim.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|towards the new door.
PS05X|Yes.
PS101|She said I've paid that that's not a hassle or anyway she's paid it she's said that's not a hassle but er I thought well maybe I some money I don't know what do you normally pay on these things twenty five twenty six.
PS05X|Oh its variable.
PS101|But it does so she said she hasn't got an up to date highway code knows anything about it about taking repair in narrow street Well I found a couple of possible useful quotes of the highway code.
PS05X|Mm Good.
PS101|I I'm going to.
PS05X|if you like.
PS101|Well she I gave her the the clause number thing.
PS05X|Right.
PS101|should be fighting for her on this not giving way.
PS05X|Well I mean who's her broker.
PS101|She doesn't have one you see.
PS05X|Oh she should use Jeffrey hasn't she.
