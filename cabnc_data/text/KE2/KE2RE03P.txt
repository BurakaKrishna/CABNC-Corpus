PS0W4|about the.
PS0W2|permission being turned down yeah.
PS0W4|No I don't blame him I mean.
PS0W2|No I don't.
PS0W4|lot of times I've you know thinking sort of is sh.
PS0W2|I mean he's got a nice house there he doesn't want it erm.
PS0W4|That's right.
PS0W2|spoiled The trouble is I mean if if it did it came up and he wanted to sell it would of it would obviously decrease the value.
PS0W4|Yeah that was what he was thinking of.
PS0W2|You'd get all the rubbish from a take-away as well blowing into his garden I mean it wouldn't have been very pleasant.
PS0W4|much he reckons his house is worth now But I suppose in a way they would have then been contemplating selling their own house and getting somewhere else before in fact.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W2|It's a shame because I mean it I think what they've got is really you know er er er they'd be hard put to it to get anything as good really at the price I think Mind you they'd probably get a hundred thousand for theirs I should think now.
PS0W4|Yes I think that's what I was thinking of.
PS0W2|Do you remember when we used to come out here for the primroses That's a long time ago isn't it.
PS0W4|Did we come out this far then.

PS0W4|somewhere er when Christopher was with us.
PS0W2|You see that's no oh no parking in this area Erm.
PS0W4|Well it doesn't matter really it was just that I sort of.
PS0W2|It looks as if there is a walk down there but we've never been on it but tell you where you may be thinking of you may be thinking of that walk that goes towards the erm adventure park at the other side of Buckfastleigh.
PS0W4|No it wasn't it was in here in the grounds of erm Dartington.
PS0W2|We've sat here in the car and watched the erm the birds down there.

PS0W2|There's a railway line down there you see.
PS0W4|Yeah Funny isn't it Have to ask Christopher if he knows I can't think of how we got in Th there's that but that looks fairly.
