PS0W2|Right what did you get.
PS0W5|Erm twenty five in two seconds.
PS0W2|Good Right so B one up to now speeds have been in metres per second we also use miles per hour M P H or M I H and kilometres per hour K M H or K M P H.
PS0W5|If the car has a constant speed of fifty miles per hour this means it goes fifty miles in every hour.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|So how far will a lorry go in three hours at a constant speed of fifty miles per hour.
PS0W5|Hundred and fifty miles.
PS0W2|Right Just shut these doors cos otherwise we're gon na get very cold in here.
PS0W5|Two people are coming in this week Gloria and Gavin.
PS0W2|Three people.
PS0W5|Three people Who.
PS0W2|Alex is coming in isn't.
PS0W5|Oh yes.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W2|well that's what comes when you have a holiday.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|Right B two if a train is going at a constant speed of ninety miles per hour how far will it go in two hours.
PS0W5|Hundred and eighty.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Do you like teaching us Terry.
PS0W2|Yes it's quite erm quite a challenge Oh yes if I've got a skill to impart I don't mind helping people.
PS0W5|How far will a plane go in four hours that has a constant speed of five hundred miles per hour Oh one two thousand miles.
PS0W2|That's right good.
PS0W5|It's been hot this like summer today isn't it.
PS0W2|It's been lovely hasn't it Mm And all the bulbs are coming out now nicely as well Everything's everything will start growing with the warmth on it.
PS0W5|And loads of people are mowing their lawns like summer today.
PS0W2|Mm I in fact mowed my lawn yesterday.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|No it was the day before yesterday.
PS0W5|It's been hot all the car is going along the motorway at a constant speed It covers a hundred and eighty miles in three hours How far does it go in one hour Sixty miles.
PS0W2|That's right.
PS0W5|Write down its speed Sixty miles per hour.
PS0W2|Mm.
PS0W5|The's top speed is two thousand three hundred kilometres per hour no kilometres er yeah how far does it fly in three hours at top speed Oh.
PS0W2|No careful.
PS0W5|Oh three times.
PS0W2|That's right.
PS0W5|Six thousand nine hundred.
PS0W2|That's right kilometres per hour.
PS0W5|Yes.
PS0W2|No kil kilometres sorry Kilometres.
PS0W5|Yes It is one thousand and fifty from London to.
PS0W2|It is what did you say.
PS0W5|It is one thousand fi and fifty kilometres.
PS0W2|One thousand two hundred and fifty.
PS0W5|two hundred and fifty.
PS0W2|kilometres from London to.
PS0W5|kilometres from London to Veneta.
PS0W2|Vienna.
PS0W5|Vienna.
PS0W2|Where's Vienna.
PS0W5|Don't know Italy.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|Venice is in Italy.
PS0W5|Oh yeah it is.
PS0W2|Vienna is the capital of Austria.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|and it's right across the other side of Austria from us Where you went skiing is this side of Austria but Vienna is about two hundred and two hundred and fifty miles further on across Austria very close to erm Czechoslovakia and erm Yugoslavia Right so it is twelve hundred and fifty kilometres from London to Vienna can a Concorde do the trip in half an hour How far does it go in an hour.
PS0W5|Two hundred and.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|thirty.
PS0W2|So can it go twelve hundred and fifty kilometres in half an hour.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W2|How far can it go in half an hour.
PS0W5|Erm one hundred and.
PS0W2|One thousand.
PS0W5|one thousand an.
PS0W2|one hundred.
PS0W5|yeah yeah fifty.
PS0W2|and fifty right so the answer is no it can only do eleven hundred and fifty kilometres in half an hour Right average speed.
PS0W5|Ha oh Terry.
PS0W2|Mhm.
PS0W5|Will you take me letterboxing one day this week if you can.
PS0W2|I don't think it's gon na be possible this week but perhaps in the Easter holidays erm.
PS0W5|Okay.
PS0W2|we'll be able to manage it.
PS0W5|Yeah Okay It is a hundred miles from King's lions.
PS0W2|King's Lynn.
PS0W5|King's Lynn where's that.
PS0W2|Erm do you know where The Wash is No if you think of a map of England erm the south coast is there there's Dover there's the estuary for London London is here erm then it comes up like this the east coast of London the east coast of E England like that this is East called East Anglia here you've got Norfolk and Norwich and then you've got Ipswich here and then you've got Suffolk there and Essex right Can you remember that bulge in the map of England Well that piece up there is called The Wash.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|and King's Lynn is close to the wash King's Lynn is in this area here.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|So from London to King's Lynn is they say a hundred miles and I'll take their word for it London to Ipswich in fact is seventy miles.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|But yeah that's about a hundred miles you see that would be about right yeah.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|So that's where it is North of London Up by The Wash Right it is a hundred miles from King's Lynn to London the train takes two hours to do the journey the train does not go at a constant speed it speeds up sometimes and slows down at other times it also stops at stations on the way and on once of course as it as it's stopping it's going more and more slowly and as it's er moving off again it starts slowly and starts to go quickly but because it takes two hours in all the train goes a hundred miles in two hours we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour It says if it was travelling at a constant speed of fifty miles an hour It doesn't sometimes it goes more slowly sometimes it goes more quickly sometimes it stops but because it takes two hours to do the hundred miles we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour Its real speed changes during the journey sometimes it is more than fifty miles per hour sometimes less but in two hours it goes the same distance as it would if its speed was fifty miles per hour all the time.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|So we say its average speed is fifty miles per hour There used to be a train called the Cheltenham Flyer there it is it went from Cheltenham to London a hundred and twenty miles in two hours do you know where Cheltenham is.
PS0W2|Well if there is the south coast along here and Devo C Cornwall is there and Devon is here and you get the w the Bristol Channel going up here and then you c the coast coming down here and there's Wales is here right Bristol is there right And if you go up from Bristol on from here you go up the motorway to Bristol and then you go along the M four to London well north of Bristol up where the River Severn gets quite narrow and can be bridged is a city called Gloucester and Cheltenham is just inland from Gloucester.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|So Cheltenham is about there and it's about a hundred and twenty miles from Cheltenham to London.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Okay.
PS0W2|So there's Cheltenham Right so it went from Cheltenham to London a hundred and twenty miles in two hours what was its average speed.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|Well if it if it average speed is a hundred and twenty miles in two hours how far in fact would it go in one hour.
PS0W5|Sixty.
PS0W2|So what was its average speed.
PS0W5|Sixty.
PS0W2|Sixty miles per hour.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|It wasn't its actual speed there will be sometimes it will be going very slowly sometimes it will be going much more quickly but its average speed was sixty miles an hour because at sixty miles an hour it would cover a hundred and twenty miles which was the distance in two hours.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|This book isn't very big is it.
PS0W2|No none of them are really are they Well this one's very small isn't it.
PS0W5|Yeah cos look.
PS0W2|Oh well you're gon na get on aren't you Great yeah you're half way through.
PS0W5|Ha Only got s nine pages.
PS0W2|Mm Right so that was C one C two it is a hundred and fifty miles from Hereford to London by rail Hereford is north of Cheltenham it's going up from Cheltenham is Hereford the first train in the morning takes three hours for the journey what's its average speed Right.
PS0W5|Can we go on the computer today.
PS0W2|Well there might be time we'll see how we get on Now it says B what did you do with th the numbers one hundred and fifty and three to get the answer.
PS0W5|Divided a hundred by three.
PS0W2|Right so you write that down you divided a hundred and fifty by three.
PS0W5|I wonder what my brother's doing now.
PS0W2|Well at the present moment it's about where he is it's about half past five twenty to six so he is probably waiting for his supper I should think his evening meal He won't be he'll have finished skiing now.
PS0W5|Mm Does it get dark over there quick.
PS0W2|It probably gets dark about the same time as it does here.
PS0W5|It's not dark quicker there now would it.
PS0W2|No it would probably be you know no it will be about this be a little bit darker than this It gets dark it'll be dark there before it is dark here.
PS0W5|Mm mm.
PS0W2|because it's further east so the sun is further away from them because the sun rises in the east so it gets light earlier that's why we put the clocks on when you go to Europe one hour.
PS0W5|Oh In America it's loads isn't it.
PS0W2|Well in America it's the other way in America i i it is after us because they are further west than we are.
PS0W5|Yeah cos it's about six hours different.
PS0W2|Mm that's right Right C three.
PS0W5|I've been to Penzance I know.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W5|where that is That's near mile end no what's it called Land's End.
PS0W2|Land's End that's right yes.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|It's right down at the far south west It's it's more than a hundred miles from us It's about a hundred and thirty miles from us down to Penzance So you know we're about two hundred miles from London so we're about only about two thirds of the way from London to Penzance.
PS0W5|Have you been to L erm Land's End since they've.
PS0W2|Yes.
PS0W5|done it all up.
PS0W2|Oh I don't know since they've done it all up no probably not.
PS0W5|It's good there now.
PS0W2|Is it.
PS0W5|Yeah they show you this.
PS0W2|Mm.
PS0W5|erm you go in this place and erm and it shows you all the boats and things and you can have a go on there's this thing where they crawl up And then you go through this door and it's all old like things and then you go and see erm and you go into this place and it's like telling you all the erm history and things like that.
PS0W2|Does it.
PS0W5|and it's got like rocks and things and erm statues doing like erm digging up gold and things a and it's got.
PS0W2|Oh yeah.
PS0W5|erm like a ship.
PS0W2|Working models.
PS0W5|Yeah And it's got a ship and erm there's people on there and it shows you this thing round the ship erm they have a storm and suddenly the sh the erm what do you call it The th that big long thing.
PS0W2|Mast.
PS0W5|Yeah that's it all fell down and it went like that.
PS0W2|yeah.
PS0W5|And there's lots of other things there as well.
PS0W2|Right Penzance is three hundred and five miles from London by rail the train leaves Penzance at five eighteen A M.
PS0W5|Ooh ooh.
PS0W2|and gets to London at ten eighteen am.
PS0W5|How many hours does the journey take Five hours.
PS0W2|Five hours.
PS0W2|And B what was the average time speed of the train.
PS0W5|Erm five into thirty goes ei si sixty five.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|Oh What's five into three hundred and.
PS0W2|Fives into three hundred and five Fives into thirty goes six.
PS0W5|Sixty one.
PS0W2|Sixty one Good Right C four from Carlisle to London is three hundred miles gracious me you see if you've got a map of England we haven't got it on here but if you imagine England going up here Carlisle is right.
PS0W2|now just think about it if you go out of your front door.
PS0W5|My front door.
PS0W2|and you turn left.
PS0W5|turn left.
PS0W2|and you go to a junction don't you.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|Now if you turn right at that junction.
PS0W5|The train station.
PS0W2|What If you turn right at that junction on which road do you go.
PS0W5|The no the erm goes to.
PS0W2|Yes which road is that What's it called.
PS0W5|I don't know.
PS0W2|You don't know.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W2|If you go out of your f well go out of the gate here and turn right.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|and go across Church Road don't go left down Decoy Road keep straight on.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|past all the new houses that have been built past the playing fields.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|and you don't know the name of that road.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W2|It is called Coach Road.
PS0W5|Ooh.
PS0W2|and it is the er it's called Coach Road because that is the road that the coaches used to go along to Totnes.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|and from Totnes to Plymouth And it is the old Coach Road So a hundred and fifty years ago you would have the stagecoach going past here.
PS0W5|Were these houses there then.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|What would of been here.
PS0W2|That house might well have been here that big house just there across th in there which has now been turned into flats.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|Er I don't know when that was built it might not have been built but it er it's Victorian so it could have been built like in eighteen thirty soon fa certainly soon after eighteen thirty that would have been built.
PS0W5|When were our houses built.
PS0W2|About nineteen sixty nineteen sixty six.
PS0W5|How old are our houses.
PS0W2|Well if they were built in sixty six and I think they were they are now how old are they now.
PS0W5|Sixty six did you say.
PS0W2|I said I think they were built in nineteen sixty six So how old are they.
PS0W5|Nineteen th eighty something years.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|Eighty four years old.
PS0W2|No Nineteen sixty six what are we now.
PS0W5|Nineteen ninety two.
PS0W2|Right well how many years is that.
PS0W5|I don't know Fifty seventy eighty ni three thirty years.
PS0W2|Well ninety six it will be thirty years.
PS0W5|So twenty twenty four years.
PS0W2|About twenty six years.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|About twenty six years.
PS0W5|That's oh I thought they were very old.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|Where have you lived in Would you a hou the house did you live into it when it was new.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W2|No I don't know ho certainly I know there had been at least two peo different lots of people living in ours before we moved in and I would think there were probably more than that Cos we moved in in about nineteen I think we moved in in nineteen eighty nineteen eighty nineteen eighty one we moved in.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|Mm.
PS0W5|in the house that she's lived in that she's in now all her life.
PS0W2|Who.
PS0W5|My nan.
PS0W2|Your nan.
PS0W5|All her life since she was little She.
PS0W2|Gracious.
PS0W5|she she came g went to the house when she came back from hospital and she's still living in it now.
PS0W2|Good lord Right come on me girl let's get on a little bit D otherwise we're not gon na have time to go on the computer.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|D well yes we can because you can you can finish it off at home can't you Yes right So D calculating journey times.
PS0W5|Oh oh look it's got the place You know there Poole is that.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W5|no it's not is it.
PS0W2|I don't know Is it what.
PS0W5|No cos can you go across there to France from there.
PS0W2|I don't know erm Portsmouth more likely.
PS0W5|Yeah that's where I'm going to go.
PS0W2|Yes Mm.
PS0W5|yeah Portsmouth.
PS0W2|Oh Portsmouth is here It's not marked but it's there is Portsmouth.
PS0W5|I'm going to France from there.
PS0W2|Are you.
PS0W5|How long does it take to get to there from our house Or from.
PS0W2|What Portsmouth.
PS0W5|from Newton Abbott.
PS0W2|To to to Portsmouth.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|Well three hours three to four hours And then it's eight hours on the boat.
PS0W5|I like boats even though I haven't even been on one.
PS0W2|Oh do you Good.
PS0W5|Yes Do you like boats.
PS0W2|Don't mind them You've never been on a big boat Have you not.
PS0W5|Haven't been on a boat I don't thi o only like little you know.
PS0W2|Oh Oh that's gon na be quite an experience then isn't it You haven't been to France then Yes you have you've flown of course.
PS0W5|No haven't been to France.
PS0W2|Well you've been to Austria.
PS0W5|I've been to Austria yeah.
PS0W2|Yes but you've flown You haven't done a been on a boat Mm.
PS0W5|Yeah no not on a boat no.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|It's nicer flying.
PS0W2|A motor boat has a speed of four miles per hour this means it goes four miles in every hour.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|how many hours does it take to go from Lulworth to Bournemouth.
PS0W5|Twenty four hours.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|Oh erm silly me.
PS0W2|It's twenty four miles.
PS0W5|Twenty four miles And how it takes a minute a mile doesn't it.
PS0W2|No What does it say it goes.
PS0W5|Twenty four miles.
PS0W2|Yeah but what is the speed of the boat.
PS0W5|Oh Four miles per hour.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Six.
PS0W2|Right six hours.
PS0W5|Six hours.
PS0W2|How long does it take how many hours does it take to go from Swanage to Ventnor.
PS0W5|Ventnor Where am I Swanage.
PS0W2|Well it tells you how far it is look.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|so you can there's Swanage and there's Ventnor.
PS0W5|That's in the Isle of Wight.
PS0W2|That's on the Isle of Wight.
PS0W5|I haven't been there Have you been there.
PS0W2|Yes.
PS0W5|Have you been that part there.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|Have you been to that part there.
PS0W2|No I don't think we landed at Cowes I think we landed over here further.
PS0W5|Did you fly.
PS0W2|No went on a hovercraft well wen went on the hovercraft and came back on a a ferry on the boat.
PS0W5|What's a hovercraft.
PS0W2|Well it's a very specialized boat in a sense I mean it goes on the surface of the water and it literally goes on the surface of the water it's a hovercraft is a sort of a it's a vessel which has got a skirt all round it.
PS0W5|Is it a rubber one.
PS0W2|Yes heavy thick rubber skirt and that the engines do two things they they drive propellers in the air and they pump air from under the vessel onto the surface of the water and the skirt round the boat.
PS0W5|Keeps dry.
PS0W2|keeps a cushion of air under the vessel so that really it hovers on top of the water and the air propellers drive it like an aeroplane.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|but it skims across the surface of the water and it's very quick it only takes half an hour to go from Ramsgate to Dover.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|Right er from Swanage to Ventnor is thirty two miles so how long would a motor boat take.
PS0W5|Eight hours.
PS0W2|Eight hours right.
PS0W5|Colin's dad's got a boat.
PS0W2|Has he And how long would it take to go round the Isle of Wight which is sixty miles round the Isle of Wight.
PS0W5|Er erm fifteen.
PS0W2|Fifteen hours right Right D two how long does it take to go from Ventnor to Swanage in a launch with a speed of eight miles per hour.
PS0W5|Oh Ventnor where's Ventnor Ah twenty two miles four.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|four hours.
PS0W2|Right now you get the answer to D two by dividing the distance by the speed.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|thirty two's the distance divided by the speed which is eight thirty two divided by eight is four this is the rule for working out a journey time distance in miles divided by speed in miles per hour gives you the time in hours Right You need a calculator.
PS0W5|I need a calculator Ooh.
PS0W2|How many hours does it take to go seven hundred and five miles at forty seven miles per hour.
PS0W5|Fifteen hours.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|This is fun I like talking into This diagram shows the reach or an airline distances are in kilometres the figures for them are only rough one a jet flies from Beirut.
PS0W2|Beirut to.
PS0W5|to Bombay at four thousand kilometres Its speed is about eight hundred kilometres per hour.
PS0W2|Eight hundred and.
PS0W5|fifty.
PS0W2|fifty.
PS0W5|kilometres per hour to work out the time it takes we do four thousand divided by three er eight hundred and fifty The answer on the calculator is four point seven O five double eight two three hours but we do not need that as that.
PS0W2|To be as exact as that.
PS0W5|because the distance is.
PS0W2|because the d not exactly four thousand miles and the speed is not exactly eight hundred and fifty kilometres per hour.
PS0W5|The nearest whole number of hours is good enough The nearest whole number of hours Do you take it by that number.
PS0W2|The nearest whole number to four point seven the wh nearest whole number to four point seven nought five double eight two three is five because to the nearest whole number you look at that four it's either gon na be four or five depending upon what that number is.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|isn't it If that's five or more then you pu increase that by one and make it five So the journey time is about five hours So D four work out these journey times to the nearest hour Bombay to Perth at about eight hundred and fifty kilometres an hour.
PS0W5|Bombay to Perth eight.
PS0W2|Hours.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|Eight hours right.
PS0W5|Rome to Beirut two hundred and.
PS0W2|Pardon.
PS0W5|Two thousand two hundred.
PS0W2|Two thousand two hundred right.
PS0W5|Four hours.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|London to.
PS0W2|London to Geneva.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|Geneva.
PS0W5|Geneva hundred and fifty One hour.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|It only takes half an hour to go to Austria doesn't it No it takes an hour.
PS0W2|No it takes an hour and a half.
PS0W5|Mm yeah It takes four hours to get to Lanzarote Six hours.
PS0W2|Good Right.
PS0W5|E.
PS0W2|Now this is quite important you've got to think about this calculate as work in decimals But we usually think of time as hours and minutes and seconds too if we are being very exact This scale shows both minutes and decimals as an hour Thirty minutes half an hour nought point five.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|right Erm fifteen minutes nought point two five Forty five minutes three quarters of an hour nought point seven five and all the different calculations in between fifty minutes is about nought point that's nought eight that's nought nine so it'd be nought point eight one two.
PS0W5|Four.
PS0W2|three isn't it Just over three.
PS0W5|Mm yeah.
PS0W2|Right So it says this scale shows both minutes and decimals and now use the scale to change these to minutes Now what's point three of an hour in minutes.
PS0W5|Ten point.
PS0W2|No nought point three's there look.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|now you want to read off the top of the scale for minutes.
PS0W5|Fifteen minutes.
PS0W2|That's ten minutes.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|that's twenty minutes that's fifteen minutes.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|what's each of those little divisions.
PS0W5|One minute.
PS0W2|Right so point three.
PS0W5|Fifteen minut er fif eighteen minutes.
PS0W2|Eighteen minutes right B nought point seven five of an hour.
PS0W5|There forty five minutes.
PS0W2|Forty five minutes C nought point four three hours nought point four three.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|four.
PS0W5|Nought point.
PS0W2|four three.
PS0W5|There.
PS0W2|That's right well what's that.
PS0W5|Twenty and six minutes.
PS0W2|Si twenty six minutes And nought point nought five of an hour.
PS0W5|There.
PS0W2|Mhm in minutes.
PS0W5|Three.
PS0W2|Three minutes Then E change these to decimals of an hour twenty four minutes.
PS0W5|Nought point four.
PS0W2|Nought point four Fifty one minutes.
PS0W5|Nought point eight five.
PS0W2|Nought point five good Five minutes.
PS0W5|Nought point nought point nought eight.
PS0W2|Right And thirty five minutes.
PS0W5|Nought point five eight.
PS0W2|Right Right well we'll just do this then you can have a go on the computer The distance from London to Weymouth is a hundred and forty three miles the train takes two hours forty two minutes for the journey.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|we can find the train's average speed like this change forty two minutes to a decimal of an hour what's that.
PS0W5|Nought point seven.
PS0W2|Right From the scale above forty two minutes equals nought point seven hours.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|that means the journey time is two point seven hours two hours forty two minutes is two point seven hours.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|divide the distance by the time hundred and forty three divided by two point seven equals fifty two point nine round off to the nearest whole number that would be.
PS0W5|Fifty three.
PS0W2|So the average speed is about fifty three miles per hour.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|So do the first one here.
PS0W5|Okay.
PS0W2|D two London to Bristol a hundred and eighteen miles at one hour twenty seven minutes.
PS0W5|Nought point f n nought point four five So one hour p one hour point point forty five.
PS0W2|One point four five.
PS0W5|Yeah Nought point one nought.
PS0W2|So that's the average speed.
PS0W5|Yeah er.
PS0W2|What did you do wrong.
PS0W5|Divided it.
PS0W2|Yes but what did you divide by what.
PS0W5|Divided a hundred and eighteen by.
PS0W2|No you didn't.
PS0W5|Oh.
