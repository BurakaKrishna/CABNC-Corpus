PS0W4|Oh they are.
PS0W7|There was a piece on the television the other day.
PS0W2|Yes.
PS0W4|Yeah we saw that.

PS0W4|yeah.
PS0W2|I don't think our squirrel is anything like as inte as intelligent as that one.
PS0W4|that one.
PS0W7|Well that one really is I mean cos I see them up in the woods quite a lot.
PS0W4|Yeah yeah.
PS0W7|cos the dog chases them before she's got anywhere near them.
PS0W4|That's right yeah When when we have my daughter's dog with us.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W4|erm she just takes off and.
PS0W7|Yeah that's right yeah.
PS0W2|If she had one wish in life it would be that she could climb trees.
PS0W7|Yeah I suppose so yeah Well she she'll take cats on.
PS0W4|Oh yeah.
PS0W7|I think she thinks they're rabbits.
PS0W4|Yeah.
PS0W7|I'm sure she does.
PS0W7|but er what's she seen She'll go up up the path and all I could see was this cat and it was hanging on for dear life up this big tree and there.
PS0W4|Yeah yeah.
PS0W7|was she sat at the bottom you know.
PS0W4|Oh yes.
PS0W7|thinking oh.
PS0W4|well Jess Jess will sort of if a cat came into our garden she'd see it off.
PS0W7|Yeah well then we don't get cats in our garden cos she she they know she's there and then.
PS0W4|she would see it off in no time at all.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W4|But we seem to er where we live erm at the top of Church Road.
PS0W7|Yeah I know yes yeah.
PS0W4|you're going down into park.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W4|whole lot of those sort of big houses have been converted into flats.
PS0W7|Flats yeah yeah.
PS0W4|and erm I think there must be some people there who have brought cats in because all of a sudden there are a whole lot of cats about which there weren't before you see.
PS0W7|Cats oh yeah I see no that's right.
PS0W4|so that er they they haven't learned to keep out of our garden yet.
PS0W7|But they have to in our garden because erm I know the first she was a the one we've got and the first day me husband brought her he went up to fetch her out the kennel and she sort of saw this cat and it's a.
PS0W7|one it's just over the fence and that.
PS0W7|and there was this ginger and white cat hanging on to our fence.
PS0W4|on for dear life.
PS0W7|you know she walked straight to me again and.
PS0W7|But she doesn't come in the garden now.
PS0W4|Aah.
