PS0W2|Smith is now in he hasn't scored yet fifty for one off thirteen overs.
PS0W4|Mm.
PS0W2|so providing they just play it steadily they should be alright there's a lot of discrimination over the Australian defeat in the paper they reckon that if erm.
PS0W4|Only no no go on what was it.
PS0W2|They reckon that if erm Australia lose another match it could mean that they won't even make the semi finals and erm they reckon like that that channel nine that's supposed to be backing all this.
PS0W4|Oh yeah aha.
PS0W2|well they think they'll pull the plug on it.
