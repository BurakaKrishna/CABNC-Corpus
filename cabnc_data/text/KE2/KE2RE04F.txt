PS0W2|It's just afternoon what time is noon.
PS0W5|Twelveo'clock.
PS0W2|So that is just eighteen minutes after noon so how long is it from nine ten in the morning until until eighteen minutes past twelveo'clock in midday So how long is it.
PS0W5|Three hours and.
PS0W2|Right so Switzerland is three hours and eight minutes isn't it.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|And you had two hours fifty two minutes right so which is the next one this one Now that's five ten P M to eleven thirty eight P M well what's five ten to eleven ten.
PS0W5|Erm six hours.
PS0W2|Six hours.
PS0W5|and eighteen minutes.
PS0W2|and eighteen minutes er wait a moment six hours and what Ten thirty eight.
PS0W5|And twenty eight.
PS0W2|Right so that is six hours and twenty eight minutes isn't it.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|Right now what's the next one Two fourteen to ten twenty er this again is easier because what would be two fourteen to ten fourteen.
PS0W5|Erm eight.
PS0W2|Eight hours so fourteen to twenty would be how many.
PS0W5|Sixteen.
PS0W2|Right so it's eight hours six minutes now the next one.
PS0W5|Erm.
PS0W2|two fifty to ten twenty nine well come back to the same sort of time the hour just before that say two fifty to nine fifty what would two fifty to nine fifty be.
PS0W5|Erm seven hours.
PS0W2|Right now you've got to go from fifty to twenty nine.
PS0W5|Erm.
PS0W2|so fifty to an hour would be.
PS0W5|Thirty nine.
PS0W2|Right thirty nine minutes so it's.
PS0W5|Seven eight hours.
PS0W2|No seven hours isn't it.
PS0W5|Seven hours.
PS0W2|Two to nine seven hours and thirty nine minutes isn't it.
PS0W5|Got thirty nine.
PS0W2|Right now this next one ten A M to two thirty seven P M well what's teno'clock.
PS0W5|Four hours.
PS0W2|Four hours and.
PS0W5|Fifty seven.
PS0W2|Right and I think the next one you got right because you worked it out alright cos it's seven days which is how many hours.
PS0W5|Five three erm seven times twenty four.
PS0W2|That's right which is.
PS0W5|Erm a hundred times twenty four.
PS0W2|Well it's a hundred and sixty eight seven times twenty four but then you've got five hours to add onto it which makes it a hundred and seventy three right so now work out your average speeds.
PS0W5|Okay but I got some right I got the actual question wrong on that one just I shall I do that one.
PS0W2|Have you got the second one didn't you get the second one oh you got that one wrong.
PS0W5|Yes.
PS0W2|Right so yes do that one this is what this is Dublin to Cork.
PS0W5|Erm one hundred and ten no one hundred and twenty.
PS0W2|Dublin to Cork it's two hundred and sixty six.
PS0W5|Oh I've done the wrong one a hundred and six I've got that and you've marked it wrong.
PS0W2|What did you divide by.
PS0W5|That.
PS0W2|What.
PS0W5|Two point five eight.
PS0W2|What's two point five hours.
PS0W5|Erm a hundred and.
PS0W2|Well what's point five of an hour.
PS0W5|Six.
PS0W2|What what fraction is point five Point five something what fraction is that.
PS0W5|Point five.
PS0W2|Yeah point five.
PS0W5|Half.
PS0W2|Right what's half an hour.
PS0W5|Thirty nine.
PS0W2|Right so two point five is two hours thirty minutes but it's not two hours thirty minutes it's two hours.
PS0W5|Fifty minutes.
PS0W2|Right so what have you got to do You've got to change the minutes to a decimal.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|haven't you.
PS0W5|Eight eight point eight three.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|What did I say point eight three Ninety four.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|erm.
PS0W2|Right now what's the next one.
PS0W5|erm Switzerland.
PS0W2|Switzerland right.
PS0W5|Eight there nought point one three.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Did I say nought point eight three.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|Nought point one three.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Nought point one three.
PS0W2|but you're not gon na divide by nought point one three are you.
PS0W5|No ninety one.
PS0W2|Right now what I shall do before you go any further is divide that at the side here what those and minutes are as decimals of an hour.
PS0W5|Nought point four seven nought point four seven.
PS0W2|What was it erm six hours twenty eight minutes was it.
PS0W5|Yes six point nought what did I say.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W5|Six point three seven.
PS0W2|No four seven isn't it.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Nought point one six five nought point four two.
PS0W2|No how long is it.
PS0W5|Twenty seven.
PS0W2|Is it twenty seven.
PS0W5|Yes.
PS0W2|Which one we dealing with.
PS0W5|Britain.
PS0W2|Right no it's not look it's teno'clock to two thirty seven what's that How many minutes.
PS0W5|Thirty seven.
PS0W2|Right so it's four hours thirty seven minutes isn't it We want thirty seven.
PS0W5|Nought point six two.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|ninety eight.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|eighty six.
PS0W2|Eighty you're not far out but it's just erm.
PS0W2|Madrid to Barcelona.
PS0W2|six eight seven.
PS0W5|Erm eight six.
PS0W2|Right just don't do it again.
PS0W5|Six.
PS0W2|Is this the seven hours thirty nine minutes.
PS0W5|Yeah six eight seven.
PS0W2|Seven hours.
PS0W5|seven.
PS0W2|thirty nine minutes.
PS0W5|Twenty six.
PS0W2|five.
PS0W5|Five no I do it the wrong way.
PS0W2|Right start again eight hundred and no it were doing.
PS0W5|I'm doing Spain that's what I'm doing anyway oh I've got that one right.
PS0W2|Right so West Germany.
PS0W5|One hundred and six.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|One three seven.
PS0W2|Right right what you didn't do almost all the time was to change those minutes to decimals of an hour wasn't it So you must remember that whenever you're dealing with speed or anything to do with hours and minutes you've got to change your minutes to the decimals of an hour before you can use your calculator.
PS0W5|Okay.
PS0W2|Now just let's have a little help here because you won't have this graph with you all the time will you.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W2|Right so how can you find out what forty minutes is.
PS0W5|Divide it by ten.
PS0W2|No what decimal fraction of an hour is forty minutes How can you find out you can use your calculator.
PS0W5|Quarter three quarters.
PS0W2|No what's what's a quarter of an hour.
PS0W5|Quarter of an hour twenty minutes fours into sixty fifteen.
PS0W2|Right so three quarters of an hour is.
PS0W5|Forty five.
PS0W2|Forty five minutes if you've got forty five minutes what's what's the fraction of an hour.
PS0W5|Over sixty.
PS0W2|Right it's forty five over sixty you want to change that into a decimal what do you do.
PS0W5|Erm divide into.
PS0W2|No how do you change any fraction into a decimal now this is something you must.
PS0W5|Divide it by ten.
PS0W2|No no no no you've got fractions here look erm now how do you change all those fractions into decimal fractions what do you do.
PS0W5|Nought point five.
PS0W2|But how did you do it You knew that but how do you do it.
PS0W5|Erm.
PS0W2|How do you do it on a calculator What does that really mean one over two how else could you write one over two How else could you write it.
PS0W5|Two over four.
PS0W2|Yes but I don't mean that erm could you would you write it as one plus two or one minus two or one multiplied by two or one divided by two.
PS0W5|One multiplied.
PS0W2|One multiplied by two Two ones are two Does a half equal two So what does that you know this which of those four rules do you do for that.
PS0W5|One.
PS0W2|What's one plus two.
PS0W5|Three.
PS0W2|What's one minus two.
PS0W5|Nothing minus.
PS0W2|one minus two.
PS0W5|One no nothing.
PS0W2|One minus two.
PS0W5|Minus two.
PS0W2|Minus one come down two come down one you get to nought come down another one.
PS0W5|Minus two.
PS0W2|so one minus one one minus two is.
PS0W5|Minus one.
PS0W2|Is minus one what's one times two.
PS0W5|Er two.
PS0W2|What's one divided by two.
PS0W5|One.
PS0W2|If you've got one apple and you divide it.
PS0W5|Half.
PS0W2|Right one divided by two is a half so which of those answers is that one Right so what does one how else can you write one over two.
PS0W5|Erm one divide.
PS0W2|One divided by two right remember that so how can I write that.
PS0W5|Forty five divided by six.
PS0W2|By.
PS0W5|Sixty.
PS0W2|Right do that on your calculator.
PS0W5|Nought point seven five.
PS0W2|Right so that equals nought point seven five what's a half Do it on the calculator.
PS0W5|Nought point five.
PS0W2|Right what's three quarters divided er as a decimal.
PS0W5|Nought point five nought point eight seven five.
PS0W2|Right so how do you change a fraction into a decimal.
PS0W5|You divide it by the bottom.
PS0W2|You divide the top number by the bottom number so supposing you've got fifty seven minutes and you want to change that into a decimal of an hour what fraction of an hour is it What's fifty seven minutes as a deci as a fraction of an hour That's forty five minutes.
PS0W5|Fifty seven over sixty.
PS0W2|Right so how do you change that into a decimal.
PS0W5|Nought point nine five.
PS0W2|Right nought point nine five so now you can see how easily you can change your minutes into a decimal at any time right now let's look at some of these this is four hours and thirty.
PS0W5|Thirty.
PS0W2|seven minutes so it's four hours four hours and thirty seven minutes so what fraction is that of an hour.
PS0W5|Erm.
PS0W2|Thirty seven minutes.
PS0W5|Forty.
PS0W2|Thirty seven minutes.
PS0W5|over sixty.
PS0W2|Right thirty seven over sixty what's thirty seven over sixty Cos the ans that is four and thirty seven sixtieths.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|so what's thirty seven sixtieths as a decimal.
PS0W5|Nought point six.
PS0W2|Right so what's four hours thirty seven minutes.
PS0W5|Four point six.
PS0W2|Point six.
PS0W5|O.
PS0W2|Well six.
PS0W5|One.
PS0W2|to the nearest two decimal places what's that gon na be Nought point six.
PS0W5|Nought point six one.
PS0W2|to do decimal places.
PS0W5|Oh two.
PS0W2|Right because that's bigger than five isn't it.
PS0W5|Yes.
PS0W2|So it's nought point six two so for our thirty seven minutes it's four point six two there we are look but the thing is you can now do it without having to look at a scale.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|So do this one what is this.
PS0W5|Four.
PS0W2|Eight hours and four minutes.
PS0W5|Four six.
PS0W2|So so what's that gon na be eight hours and four minutes.
PS0W5|Nought point nought.
PS0W2|It's it's eight hours.
PS0W5|Yes.
PS0W2|so it's gon na be eight not nought isn't it.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|It's gon na be eight point.
PS0W5|Nought one.
PS0W2|Nought what.
PS0W5|One.
PS0W2|Nought one what's that.
PS0W5|Mm erm nought.
PS0W2|Nought six six so it's gon na be to two decimal places it's gon na be.
PS0W5|Nought point nought seven.
PS0W2|Right so it's gon na be eight point.
PS0W5|Nought seven.
PS0W2|eighty point nought seven right.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|So you now know how you can change your minutes to decimals.
PS0W5|To decimals.
PS0W2|Right now you may have to do that on this next one.
PS0W5|Tired.
PS0W2|I can see that.
PS0W5|Oh my brother does motor racing.
PS0W2|I know he does Have you heard from your brother.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|How is he.
PS0W5|He's okay he says the resorts are very good.
PS0W2|Does he and the snow good.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|And has he been up to the top of the.
PS0W5|I don't know I wasn't there when mummy.
PS0W2|oh I see so what's today Thursday he's only got today and tomorrow left hasn't he for skiing.
PS0W5|That's Silverstone.
PS0W2|That's right.
PS0W5|Yes I know where that is.
PS0W2|Do you.
PS0W5|Yes.
PS0W2|Have you been there.
PS0W5|No my brother has.
PS0W2|Has he.
PS0W5|He might have I don't he probably has.
PS0W2|Right so it shows a Silverstone motor racing circuit.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|Right so what's the first.
PS0W5|circuit has five corners and ten kerbs car start.
PS0W5|ha car start near Woodcape Corner and go clockwise which corner do they come from first.
PS0W5|aha Copse Corner.
PS0W2|Right Copse Corner what would you expect to find at Copse Corner.
PS0W5|Ten cops.
PS0W2|And what's a copse.
PS0W5|I don't know.
PS0W2|That's what I wanted to find out.
PS0W2|You don't know what copse is.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W2|A copse is a smallish group of trees.
PS0W5|Is there lots of trees there.
PS0W2|Well there would be yes I would imagine or if they certainly would they would of been in the past they may have been cut down but that would indicate to me that there were probably trees.
PS0W5|Probably been cut down.
PS0W2|at that corner a group of trees.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|Copse Corner copse er is is a name which we give to a small wood a small group of trees is a copse in India that can be called a shola S H O L A.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|and at one stage when I was walking in India we used to stay at bungalows and one was called Marian Shola and another was called Pine Shola because it meant that it was a it was a bungalow in a group of pine trees.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|but copse is a small group of trees right so the next one B.
PS0W5|Which curve is just after Beckett Chapel kerb.
PS0W2|Chapel kerb.
PS0W5|Wonder who's got a Chapel there.
PS0W2|I should think almost certainly there was a chapel at that point.
PS0W5|Famous people go there.
PS0W2|Oh they do indeed yes.
PS0W5|Mm mm which corner is at the end of Hammer Street Stow Corner.
PS0W2|That's right.
PS0W5|Why is that called Stow.
PS0W2|I wouldn't know that one.
PS0W5|Banker's got a nice track.
PS0W2|I hate to think what was in that corner too.
PS0W5|Ugh.
PS0W2|Oh dear right.
PS0W5|Look I have a magic pencil.
PS0W2|You have a magic pencil.
PS0W5|It moves.
PS0W2|mm.
PS0W5|Car going from Woodcape to Copse who.
PS0W2|To Copse.
PS0W5|Car will be travelling roughly from west to east or eastwards.
PS0W2|Yes now remember that what that means west to east is in fact going eastwards.
PS0W5|Yes.
PS0W2|Where would it be travelling roughly southwards.
PS0W5|Where am I going from Woodcape southwards that way.
PS0W2|Which is southwards.
PS0W5|Down.
PS0W2|Right so where would the car be travelling in a southward direction.
PS0W5|There.
PS0W2|Right so how would you describe that stretch it's going from.
PS0W5|Copse Corner to.
PS0W2|right.
PS0W5|Oh there we go.
PS0W2|Right so where would it be going roughly going.
PS0W5|going northwards.
PS0W2|Northwards.
PS0W5|Going up.
PS0W2|So where would that be from.
PS0W5|There.
PS0W2|There to.
PS0W5|to Woodcape Corner.
PS0W2|Right.
