KE2PSUN|Let's see what we've got ooh I du n no if I've got ooh yes I have Yes I have That'll be ninety pence won't it Five tens are.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|fifty five eights are forty ninety pence Good job I learnt my tables when I was at school.
PS0W2|There's a lot that don't do it these days.
KE2PSUN|Well my son does They're very hard at his school we've always done them It's very important.
PS0W2|It's ever so important.
KE2PSUN|But from an early age because without.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|tables you can't do multiplication.
PS0W2|It takes so it takes so long to do everything you see.
KE2PSUN|You can't do anything.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|You know and I mean where he used to go to school they didn't teach them them till they were ten What the hell of a use is that.
PS0W2|No good at all.
KE2PSUN|So I mean he is very very good at his tables and we bought one of those Early Learning tapes when he was quite young that you sing.
PS0W2|Yeah.
KE2PSUN|to.
PS0W2|Mm.
KE2PSUN|And I always learnt mine parrot fashion using.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|sticks.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|And then we got a table tester to help them refresh their memories it's like a disc and then you got the slots and then it tells you your eight times and that's good as well but I mean he's got them off by heart which is brilliant.
PS0W2|Well it it saves so much time as well you see because and you get on so much quicker with everything.
KE2PSUN|Well absolutely And I mean fortunately he is very good at his maths and he's quick at his sums and things because he knows his tables There's erm.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|so much difference.
PS0W2|Well I've got I pu put a program on I've got a computer and I.
KE2PSUN|Oh yes.
PS0W2|put a program on the computer for maths.
KE2PSUN|Oh right.
PS0W2|and it's er it's erm it's a table program amongst others adding.
KE2PSUN|Oh that's good.
PS0W2|and subtraction and multiplication.
KE2PSUN|Yeah.
PS0W2|But you know they can pick it and er it just flashes up and they have to put the right answer in if they get the right answer it it goes on to the next one if it.
KE2PSUN|Oh that's good.
PS0W2|get the wrong answer.
KE2PSUN|Yeah.
PS0W2|then i it says no that's wrong Sorry la whatever he name is that.
KE2PSUN|What age group is that for then.
PS0W2|Well this is really for anybody learning the tables But primarily it's it's it's you know top end of the primary school.
KE2PSUN|Oh it sounds good.
PS0W2|But you co could go on I mean if you if they don't know it you can still use it when they get to secondary school.
KE2PSUN|What computer is that then.
PS0W2|Oh it's er it's erm.
KE2PSUN|B B C or.
PS0W2|It's a Tandy actually it's one I had.
KE2PSUN|Yeah.
PS0W2|given me about eight.
KE2PSUN|Right.
PS0W2|years ago So and it's an old one actually.
KE2PSUN|Oh.
PS0W2|but I've put put my own program so that the.
KE2PSUN|Ah That's a good idea.
PS0W2|But how old is your.
KE2PSUN|He's nearly ten Yeah Nearly ten But he has we we've only got my husband's got a computer at work we just got one of the Segas the master systems you know that you you got th the games that you put in those but he wants to get another one next year but that's a good idea something like that Should be very good for schools I would think wouldn't it.
PS0W2|Well yes of course I mean I the schools have got programs I mean you can you know they er.
KE2PSUN|Yeah Yeah.
PS0W2|Da ta for it.
KE2PSUN|Yes But that's I think that's a brilliant idea actually Because where he goes is a smaller school where they go and erm I think something like that is nice for them to actually.
PS0W2|Where does he go.
KE2PSUN|He goes to a school in the Tene Valley it's a teacher that he used to go to Exeter school and the teacher's opened her own school and only for lo a small time and then she's opening up actually in Exeter but this is an in between and she's a very good teacher.
PS0W2|That's great you see.
KE2PSUN|And you see she's bringing him on very well.
PS0W2|Yeah.
KE2PSUN|I mean there's only a few kids there they're all good mates and it's like private tuition But I.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|mean you pay for it course you do but then.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|on the ar we well you know we've paid for his education since he was seven because he wasn't doing anything at primary school Half the teachers le left them doing nothing.
PS0W2|It's a shame really.
KE2PSUN|Yeah Yeah But er you know and it would have been such a waste cos he's bright But that he was always naughty They used to write back and they said he was always being sent out and I said that's because he's bored He couldn't be bothered you see And how many more children slip through the net that way.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|It's very true An and so we we said right that's it We'll have to get him out and pay for it and it's worked total dividends I mean he's very good at maths They say maths and science are his strength subjects well I'd never have known that if he was still over there I was just told he was a a fair average You know.
KE2PSUN|Erm can I have sixteen of those there.
