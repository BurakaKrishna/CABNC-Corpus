PS0W2|Yes erm on the other hand there are some.
PS0W2|there are some very good comprehensive schools.
KE2PSUN|Oh yes.
PS0W2|I mean you can't you can't erm.
KE2PSUN|Thank you.
KE2PSUN|Thank you love.
PS0W2|There's some very bad grammar schools.
KE2PSUN|Yeah I agree with you.
PS0W2|You know again as you said earlier on it all comes down in the end to the head.
KE2PSUN|You see we've had some very good reports I mean that went through a very bad patch but they've this new Doctor Colin he's meant to be pretty switched on.
PS0W2|Mm.
KE2PSUN|and erm they say you know it's it's turning into a very good school So that's one possibility to look at But I mean a a grammar doesn't suit every child does it Some kids erm er you know.
PS0W2|No it doesn't you see I mean I yo I would always say you know if a child was borderline.
KE2PSUN|Mm.
PS0W2|If there was a doubt then he would be better not going to a grammar school.
KE2PSUN|Mm.
PS0W2|because he would be at the top end of the other school.
KE2PSUN|That's right That is exactly that.
PS0W2|and then success breeds success.
KE2PSUN|That's right That's right.
PS0W2|Erm whereas.
KE2PSUN|Right.
PS0W2|er the same child goes to the grammar school he's in the C stream he's at bottom.
KE2PSUN|Yeah.
PS0W2|at the end and they perhaps don't bother quite so much and.
KE2PSUN|Yeah.
PS0W2|he he drops back he gets.
KE2PSUN|Yeah.
PS0W2|further and further and further behind.
KE2PSUN|Yeah Now I found that you see cos I passed my eleven plus and I lived in Hampshire and the grammar school was Hampshire Grammar School for Girls which was quite a long way away from where I lived and it would have entailed a bus and the train and I and there was only me that passed and I I didn't wan na do it So I went to a very good secondary school but I was in the A one stream right the way through and I was always within that top three of that A one stream and it gave me confidence and I really got on And I never regretted not going.
PS0W2|No That's right.
KE2PSUN|You know a lot of people said to me oh how stupid To my mum you know she's passed you're daft but there'd have been so much hassle for me to get there.
PS0W2|Yeah.
KE2PSUN|And I didn't feel confident and I wasn't happy within.
PS0W2|Yeah.
KE2PSUN|myself and my mum said if you're not then you don't.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|wan na go.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|And that's how I felt about.
PS0W2|Yeah.
KE2PSUN|it I didn't and I felt I'd have no friends around where I lived and you know I'd always be alienated I'd always be home later and I said to my mum I don't think I can cope with it so she said right then you don't go And I didn't And I never regretted it I'll be quite honest with you And I think lots of children probably feel that way.
PS0W2|Yeah.
KE2PSUN|And.
PS0W2|That's right.
KE2PSUN|you know But it's.
PS0W2|Ha.
KE2PSUN|nice talking to someone about education cos I talk to some people and they think I'm crackers cos I took my kid out of a state school You know.
PS0W2|Ya I I I'm only sorry that you felt you.
KE2PSUN|Yeah that.
PS0W2|had to And I'm sorry.
KE2PSUN|I am.
PS0W2|the fact that you had to.
KE2PSUN|I am.
PS0W2|Erm but I you know I think that's that that's an indictment of it you see because I.
KE2PSUN|Oh it's cost us an arm and a leg It really has.
PS0W2|Yeah sure.
KE2PSUN|An and it's what makes me so cross as I walk past that blinking school every day and you think my kid should be over there.
PS0W2|That's it.
KE2PSUN|That's just the way I feel.
PS0W2|Yeah I know it's sad isn't it.
KE2PSUN|Do you know what I mean.
PS0W2|Yeah I do I do know what you.
KE2PSUN|Yeah.
PS0W2|mean and I think it's it's it's a shame It's awful really.
KE2PSUN|when I speak about it I get so upset that they've got three or four and they can't.
