PS0W5|Elizabeth had won the essay competition and was just about to stand up when Jessica got up and she walked up to Mr and she asked and he asked her what magazine she wanted for the year and she said Rock Seventeen Jessica knew what magazine Elizabeth wanted and she just said Rock Seventeen Then she had to stay behind and got Jessica's detention and was late for her next lesson and got another detention for running in the main building But the trouble was they were both at the same time after school where she was meant to be decorating the hall for the disco after school that night Then she got Jessica's C for her cooking class instead of the A Jessica got off hers But after school she went to her detention with Mr and course the note said going to the dentist sudden toothache So she went to her other detention and there was another note saying had to pick up my child from school So she went to decorate the hall and got sent out with people saying she was Jessica Elizabeth slammed the kitchen door and dropped her bag What's wrong said Jessica So Elizabeth told her everything that had happened today and after half an hour they decided to tell everyone what the they had done at the disco that night So that night at the disco they told them and at last they believed them and sorted out the magazine thing and changed the magazine to Mysteries from Around the World And then they changed the cookery marks And Jessica said I'll race to the cake and the twins were back to normal.
PS0W2|Mm Now right Well I am going to have to look at them both And see if I I like them both There's there's a lot of work gone into those Erm i if I'm honest I think I found Holly's easier to understand on a first reading but that may be because I think perhaps read it Perhaps in a slightly more clearer way than you did That doesn't mean that yours isn't as good So I what I want to do now and I have do eve take time to do it I can't do it just now when you're here But I want to look at them both and I will go through them as well and mark them for spelling and for for your punctuation and everything else But really you both put a tremendous amount of work in They're great.
PS0W5|Can I just say something.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W5|Cos didn't gon na say know when Jessica got up cos I've got pretend erm got up for the erm.
PS0W2|So what's it What is it It's April Fool.
PS0W5|Yeah it's April Fool's.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W5|day Er what they do every year they switch identities e Jessica pretends to be Elizabeth and Elizabeth pretends to be Jessica but this year they don't do that cos tha all their friends like know and this year cos their teachers and things still think that they're erm so they swapped identities they like give detention and things to the wrong people and stuff like that And when Jessica gets up to do get the magazine it's cos Mr told her but course she thought it was Je erm Elizabeth but she wa wasn't so.
PS0W2|What's D T.
PS0W5|That's detention.
PS0W2|She went to her detention I see Right.
PS0W5|So we just sort of say essay D T to show what I mean.
PS0W2|Yeah Well well yes we used to get used to get detention yes but erm the thing we used to get more than anything else was pink paper.
PS0W6|Mm.
PS0W5|Did you have to take it home to your parents.
PS0W2|Pink paper.
PS0W5|To show that you've.
PS0W2|was.
PS0W5|been naughty.
PS0W2|Pink paper was a foolscap sheet of paper like like that.
PS0W6|Mm.
PS0W2|but it was pink.
PS0W5|Pink.
PS0W2|And if you had to do if you had say three sheets of pink paper because you've been naughty and done something wrong you had to fill three sides of pink foolscap paper with writing You might have to write an essay or you do copy writing on the pa do three sheets of pink paper you had to three sheets of writing And it was pink paper and at the top it had space for your parent's signature so that when you've done the work your parents had to.
PS0W6|Mm.
PS0W2|sign it so they'd know if you'd had pink paper.
PS0W5|What erm.
PS0W2|That was the that was the worst that was the pink paper and then.
PS0W5|what we normally have to do.
PS0W2|you got yo would have to take and hour or take two hours or take three hours and if you take up to three hours or if you got three separate hours that was detention and if we were in our in the junior part of the school in the first three forms erm you then had to go into school on Saturday morning In the senior school we had to go into school Saturday morning anyway.
PS0W6|And you had Wednesday.
PS0W2|We we.
PS0W6|afternoon off.
PS0W2|No we didn't We we worked Monday to Saturday.
PS0W6|Our when my.
PS0W2|morning.
PS0W6|When my.
PS0W2|We had games on Wednesday afternoon but we had in the senior school.
PS0W6|When my.
PS0W2|we had school on Saturday morning as well as the rest of the week.
PS0W6|My erm my dad's mum they used to go to school Monday Tuesday Wednesday morning have Wednesday afternoon off all day Thursday all day Friday and Saturday morning But they would have Wednesday afternoon off.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W6|For some reason.
PS0W2|Okay So we've got a little time left Erm let's have a look at your English these English progress papers.
PS0W6|Okay.
PS0W2|Because I want to do a little bit of that erm we are going.
PS0W5|Ah.
PS0W2|what page are we on now.
PS0W6|We started something last week I mean I've finished that.
PS0W2|Yes what paper was that.
PS0W5|The Locuses.
PS0W6|About the Locusts.
PS0W2|What page was that.
PS0W6|I don't know.
PS0W5|I don't know.
PS0W5|Here it is Here's the page.
PS0W2|Page twenty eight Page twenty eight That's right Now how far did we get with that.
PS0W5|Erm we finished the bit about the locusts.
PS0W2|Right So.
PS0W6|Ten to five.
PS0W2|Okay.
PS0W2|Number eight we've got to do I think.
PS0W5|Look look Look.
PS0W2|Yes Number eight.
PS0W6|I think you hold it right at the end.
PS0W5|Do you.
PS0W6|Do this don't you.
PS0W5|Oh you do don't you.
PS0W2|Did we mark it.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W6|The.
PS0W2|Did we not mark it.
PS0W6|They're all ma they're alright though Cos we didn't.
PS0W2|Cos we but we didn't the last one So right Okay So we'll go on to page that page twenty eight number eight If you'd like to do it now and then we'll mark it.
PS0W5|Number eight.
PS0W2|Number eight.
PS0W6|Paper over.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W6|there.
PS0W5|Yes.
PS0W6|Underline the correct answer in the brackets.
PS0W2|So write it down don't underline it Just write the write the sentence down.
PS0W6|How do you write it though.
PS0W2|You got ta choose the correct one.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|This should be very apt from what you've just been doing.
PS0W6|Mm.
PS0W5|My am I am I an author now.
PS0W2|I don't know.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|That might well be mightn't it.
PS0W2|I know I'm no I'm just coming to sort you out because as you say you did that with Mrs So you haven't done this yet.
PS0W6|I've done that Terry.
PS0W2|Right Wait for Lucy to do it and then we'll read it out.
PS0W5|Oh Ooh ooh ooh.
PS0W6|Don't think the spelling's wrong.
PS0W5|Yes I have Cos I I'm usually a good speller One of these Over to dad and Becky.
PS0W6|Oh she's terrible.
PS0W5|Mm Doesn't know how to spell scene.
PS0W2|Does she not.
PS0W6|No she.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W6|i when we have like something like scene one she puts S double E N.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|Oh.
PS0W6|She doesn't know how to spell having She goes she puts erm A hey no H H A V E I N G She's useless at spelling.
PS0W2|Right so what have you got there.
PS0W2|Well now it should a be a person who writes books is.
PS0W5|An.
PS0W2|An.
PS0W5|An.
PS0W6|Oh.
PS0W2|An author.
PS0W6|Mm.
PS0W2|An author Why do you put an instead of a.
PS0W6|Because it's got a vowel.
PS0W2|Because author.
PS0W5|A vowel.
PS0W2|comme starts with an A right a vowel Right number nine So do number nine.
PS0W6|Mhm Oh.
PS0W2|So what have you got.
PS0W5|It's a journalist.
PS0W6|Journalist.
PS0W2|A person who writes articles for a newspaper is a journalist.
PS0W5|For a newspaper is a journalist.
PS0W6|Journalist.
PS0W2|Good Right Number ten then.
PS0W5|When he breaks Oh sorry I didn't mean to.
PS0W2|It's when.
PS0W2|we break into a house to steal is called a.
PS0W5|It's called it's called a prisoner.
PS0W6|Mm mm Do you know the story o first of all I was gon na write about fairground about a erm ghost.
PS0W5|Ghost.
PS0W6|train then I thought no I wouldn't write that Then I was gon na write about a hotel you know erm Heartbreak Hotel thought no wouldn't write about that Want something exciting so I thought a murder.
PS0W2|Yes So it's a burglar right B U R G L A R.
PS0W6|A murder.
PS0W2|E actually yours made me think of a story that I was told many years ago on a coach trip over Dartmoor.
PS0W6|Mm.
PS0W2|when a lady who lived on Dartmoor for many many years erm was telling stories of things that had actually happened.
PS0W5|True.
PS0W2|to her Well for instance that she lived in a in an old vicarage cos her husband had been a a no a tri priest in the Church of England and er we her house was haunted and she was telling us stories and sh she quite often saw the ghost she was never worried she never cos it never frightened her it wasn't vicious or anything like that and she often saw it quite matter of fact As a matter of fact she often saw this ghost But she was telling the story of a man who was travelling over the moor and it was many years ago on horseback and er he was completely lost and wan it was getting dark and he wanted to stay somewhere for the night and he sort of travelled and couldn't see anywhere and eventually down a long drive he saw a house wi blazing with lights so he went down this house and er all the windows were alight you know were lit up and he knocked at the door and knocked at the door and knocked at the door and couldn't get any answer no one ever came to the door so in desperation he thought well this is no good So he went back up onto the main road and very little further on in fact he in fact found a village and spent the night at the hostelry and he said to the man in the hostelry you know he that he'd been lost and that a a little bit back on the road he'd seen this big house all alight and he had erm you know gone in the drive and tried to get get a room there but couldn't make anybody hear and the erm the inn keeper said no he said er you wouldn't make anyone hear there he said and if you go back there tomorrow the house won't be there And he went back and it wasn't.
PS0W6|Weird.
PS0W5|Why not.
PS0W2|It had gone.
PS0W6|What a ghost made it.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W5|I like I love.
PS0W2|Told a lot of ghost stories yes.
PS0W5|I love listening.
PS0W2|in my.
PS0W5|to ghost stories in Dartmoor.
PS0W6|Oh I know this really story.
PS0W5|Go on then.
PS0W6|Right it's about this erm lady I'll make it that she lived on Dartmoor with her erm grandson erm and her moth and he sa daughter and she is a gran she was a grandlady a grandmother.
PS0W5|A grandlady.
PS0W6|And erm they lived in this little cottage and erm every night erm the moth she would always stay up really late and the mother and erm her son would go to bed and she would always go out of this erm go out of the house every night and she would go cos she had these three fingers which were blades.
PS0W5|Oh.
PS0W6|you know like Freddy Kruger three fingers that looked like blades and every night she would go to erm the fields and erm she would go into sheep fields and cow fields and she would kill three sheep and a cow every night except for a Sunday night Every morning farmers would come and they would see this claw mark on the neck of these of their sheep and their cows and they were they were quite worried cos all their sheep and cows were like dying every night They were quite worried about it And so they went to report to the to the police but and th I mean they didn't believe them they thought it was just like birds And erm and she kept doing this for ages and erm she was she was sta starting to get worried because people might believe find out that it was her and so after she killed a cow she took out all of i all it's insides and hid in it and no one ever found her.
PS0W2|Oh dear Terrible.
PS0W6|And then she.
PS0W2|Ooh.
PS0W5|Ooh.
PS0W6|she was.
PS0W5|It's horrible isn't it.
PS0W6|And then she hid inside this cow.
PS0W2|Mm.
PS0W6|And she killed it.
PS0W2|Right I think we'd.
PS0W5|Ha.
PS0W2|better leave it at that hadn't we Will you before you come to me next time.
PS0W6|Mhm.
PS0W2|finish down to number twenty eight And learn those spellings Right So that's going to be page twenty eight and twenty nine Okay learn your spellings Now I'll have to talk to your mums but it may well be that I shan't be here in a fortnight's time so we may.
PS0W6|Oh.
PS0W2|have to put things back a week.
PS0W6|Okay.
PS0W2|But we'll we'll think about that nearer the time Alright.
PS0W5|Okay.
PS0W2|Okey-doke And you'll leave your compositions with me and I will look up and if I can get the marks before then as I probably will I'll let you have them back Okay.
PS0W5|Okay.
PS0W2|Right So one more week to go and then you've got a holiday.
PS0W5|Yes.
PS0W2|Ha hum.
PS0W6|At last.
PS0W2|Yeah that's right Right Bye bye girls.
PS0W5|Bye bye Ballet now.
PS0W2|Cor you got ballet now have you.
PS0W6|Yes we.
PS0W2|Hello Adrian Alright.
PS0W7|Yes thanks.
PS0W2|So all set for a break tomorrow.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|Thank you Have I got to give your mummy change this time.
PS0W7|Er yeah.
PS0W2|It looks like it.
PS0W7|Oh yeah.
PS0W2|doesn't it.
PS0W7|I'll go and get some.
PS0W2|I know right That's alright That's fine Erm right What book are we on Four A.
PS0W7|It's alright this is erm yours.
PS0W2|Yeah I know I was looking for the erm oops Now right So how have we got on with that.
PS0W7|Er ah I did some at home but we haven't done any booklet work this week.
PS0W2|You haven't done any booklet work Okay.
PS0W7|Because we've been doing Pythagoras theorem.
PS0W2|Oh have you.
PS0W7|Yeah I'll just show you what we've been doing.
PS0W2|Yeah Show us what you've been doing You understand it.
PS0W7|Yeah well sort of We're erm that's the booklet I'm on at the moment.
PS0W2|What's this one I haven't seen this one Oh.
PS0W7|It's it's er.
PS0W7|Yeah Did that yu yesterday Not all that.
PS0W2|Is that from here.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W7|Work from that And an an the the sheets And now I've just started this I'm gon na finish the end of C six for homework and I'm on C six A And that's what we've been doing all about it.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W7|Okay.
PS0W2|Yeah So do you wan na finish that now.
PS0W7|Yeah please.
PS0W2|Right okay.
PS0W7|I I knew that erm I uns I sa understand some of it but some of it I find a bit hard to understand like this bit it says be careful sometimes the unknown side is is the longest side and sometimes it is not But I thi I I can't I know that you have to take it away.
PS0W2|Yes but the thing is this in a right angle triangle.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|the longest side is called what Cos it.
PS0W7|The hypotenuse.
PS0W2|The hypotenuse right So the longer side is always the hypotenuse.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|Right Now what is the formula for your Pythagoras theorem.
PS0W7|The sum of the erm I do I don't I know my dad's taught me a different one to Miss she she taught me that erm i the oh hang on It's back here I got a new book today so but she taught that is was ha Erm if I can find it The right angle triangle The areas and squares on the two short sides add together to equal the area on the square of the hypotenuse.
PS0W2|Right The square on the hypotenuse.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|The square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
PS0W7|Okay.
PS0W2|Alright.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|And the squ hypotenuse is always the longest side It's the side opposite the right angle.
PS0W7|Mhm.
PS0W2|So there's your right angle that is the hypotenuse and the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares that's the su the area of that square and the area of that square add together the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
PS0W7|Okay.
PS0W2|Alright The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides So what they're saying is this that the square on that side.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|is thirty six so what's the length of that side.
PS0W7|Erm that must be nine.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W7|Sorry Aha What then.
PS0W2|The square root of thirty six What two numbers amount to.
PS0W7|Six.
PS0W2|That's right So the that side must be six centimetres.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|The square is six times six which is thirty six That is four square centimetres.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|It's four centimetres and the square is sixteen so what must be the area of that square.
PS0W7|Twenty.
PS0W2|Twenty Right So you've got to find what number multiplied together makes twenty.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|So it's going to the length of that side is going to be the.
PS0W7|So you square the root of twenty Find the square root of twenty don't you.
PS0W2|You find the square root of twenty That's right And how do you find the square root of twenty.
PS0W7|Just use that.
PS0W2|You'll use that yes.
PS0W7|Mm mm.
PS0W2|Aren't you lucky.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|Because I we never had sa we never had erm calculators.
PS0W7|Wha what did you have to do then.
PS0W2|So you had to find the square root of by ar either arithmetic by.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|doing in an arithmetic way or you had to use a sca a log table You had to use log tables You had to use this sort of thing like find it up in a mess hasn't it Erm I had to go to a table like that which said square roots and I had to look up twenty.
PS0W7|It's got on the back actually Back of this book.
PS0W2|Square roots twe.
PS0W7|Oh yeah.
PS0W2|square root is twenty and it's four point four seven two one.
PS0W7|Yeah square root.
PS0W2|That's right But as you say you can use this.
PS0W2|Which one do you push now.
PS0W7|That one.
PS0W2|That's right Four point four seven two.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|So you know that's well the way you do it So th that's how you find that So now when you got these three here.
PS0W7|I've done these.
PS0W2|You've done those have you.
PS0W7|Yeah look Here are.
PS0W2|Well let's see that you got them right shall we.
PS0W7|Six five A.
PS0W2|So this one you've got twenty five equals nine plus some number Right.
PS0W7|Mhm.
PS0W2|So that is going to be sixteen isn't it.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|No it isn't.
PS0W7|Yes it is.
PS0W2|Yes it is sixteen So what's that gon na be.
PS0W7|Sixteen to erm square root of sixteen.
PS0W2|Sixteen.
PS0W7|is four.
PS0W2|Four So that's.
PS0W2|gon na be four So C five A have you got four.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|Yes you have Right Now B again that the square root of that is going to equal the square root of that plus the square root of that So you've got sixteen.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|Or rather sixty four e eighty one equals sixty four plus some number So sixty four from eighty one.
PS0W7|Gives you six which is erm seventeen so it's.
PS0W2|Gives you.
PS0W7|er seventeen.
PS0W2|Gives you seventeen So now for the answer to that one.
PS0W7|The square root of seventeen.
PS0W2|you want the square root of seventeen which is four point one two Right.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|So C again you've got eleven elevens what are eleven elevens.
PS0W7|Er a hundred and twenty one.
PS0W2|A hundred and twenty one equals thirty six plus some number.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|So what is a hundred and twenty one less thirty six.
PS0W7|Erm er is it six erm erm si.
PS0W2|Eighty five.
PS0W7|eighty five sorry.
PS0W2|Have you got eighty five The square root of eighty five Yes you have Er the square root of eighty five that sounds reasonable so I would assume that's right D you've got sixty four equals.
PS0W7|Mhm.
PS0W2|twenty five plus some number so what's that Thirty nine.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|The square root of thirty nine which is obviously reasonable so that's alright Right So how's.
PS0W7|Mm.
PS0W2|C six And you can't do C six.
PS0W7|So that those are alright.
PS0W2|Yes you can mar well yes you can do.
PS0W7|They're wrong aren't they I'll mark them right.
PS0W2|Why don't you tick it neatly.
PS0W7|I do.
PS0W2|As I've said before You don't.
PS0W7|Okay then.
PS0W2|No it's alright Leave.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|it now but erm.
PS0W7|Oh that's alright.
PS0W2|that's you know you should erm Okay So you're going to do C six I will do them while you do them.
PS0W7|Okay.
PS0W2|Cos I.
PS0W7|Is that the hypotenuse Yes.
PS0W2|Which is the hypotenuse.
PS0W7|That one.
PS0W2|Which one.
PS0W7|The opposite one to the right angle.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W7|So it's that one.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W7|So so it must be it is erm can I write it down on here.
PS0W2|I'll tell you what write it down on paper and then you can copy it into your book when you know you've got it right How about that.
PS0W7|Hang on a sec Five point three nine.
PS0W2|Right I'll settle for that.
PS0W7|Is that right the way I've done it By the way I I did that so I did area of square along the side.
PS0W2|Well I mean you've got the right answer so erm.
PS0W7|Shall I just write shall I copy it in.
PS0W2|Yes what have you done.
PS0W7|Erm five equals twenty five mm.
PS0W2|Five doesn't equal twenty five.
PS0W7|Five fives are twenty five.
PS0W2|You haven't got five times you've got five equals twenty five Five square equals twenty five.
PS0W7|That's what I've been doing I meant I mean that.
PS0W2|Yahhh But if you write that look Five equals twenty five is not true Five squared equals twenty five yes.
PS0W7|Okay then.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W7|Yeah.
PS0W2|Be very precise But you shouldn't ever write five equals twenty five cos it doesn't.
PS0W7|Okay then.
PS0W2|You mean five squared you mean five times five equals twenty five you're looking for five squared so that's the right thing to write Alright.
PS0W7|Okay That is the hypotenuse isn't it That there.
PS0W2|Yes Mhm.
PS0W7|C Do you do ninety nine take twenty five.
PS0W2|Which one are we doing.
PS0W7|B Erm I'm gon na do.
PS0W2|What have you got.
PS0W7|Er.
PS0W2|You've got you've got nine nines are eighty one nine squared equals eighty nine squared equals.
PS0W7|Ah so.
PS0W2|what.
PS0W7|Eighty one equals nine.
PS0W2|Ah pa cha cha cha cha cha Right Five squared equals twenty five right now what have you got to do.
PS0W7|Nine into ninety erm eight in eighty one take twenty five.
PS0W2|That's right.
PS0W7|So erm that'll be se fifty five fifty fifty six.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W7|So then you square root it.
PS0W2|That's right.
PS0W7|Seven point four eight.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W7|Is it a hundred take nine.
PS0W2|That's right.
