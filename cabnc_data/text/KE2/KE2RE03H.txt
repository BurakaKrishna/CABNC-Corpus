PS0W4|Oh I thought it was me making all that noise I was breathing and I could hear sort of I was thinking first of all it was coming from you know somewhere outside like somebody.
PS0W4|sawing a tree or something Widening the road here or something.
PS0W2|Yes just widening it and straightening out some of the bends.

PS0W4|Nice little waterfall things.
PS0W2|Yes a weir.
PS0W4|It's good to have those on the ground you know for people who are gosh who are you know incapacitated But sometimes people think well they're only for disabled but I don't believe that's so.
PS0W2|No I don't think it is either.
PS0W4|because I think to myself well you know if there are no disabled people about and more often than not there are not why shouldn't anybody use them.
PS0W2|That's it.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W4|we're going past.
PS0W2|Mm.

PS0W4|through it.
PS0W2|that's right.
PS0W4|had to take a sort of erm south to erm not just thought of both the names and the other one but they would be nearer to Exeter but it wouldn't be sort of in Exeter itself I was thinking you know probably get erm you know see if there's any new houses being built there and what sort of price and what have you.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W2|I'm not quite sure where you mean.
PS0W4|Well it's sort of on its way to Exeter Chudleigh.

PS0W2|The Coach House.
PS0W4|House Funnily enough I was going to say to you when we were out at erm Dartington instead of buying that ice cream we should of had a cup of tea probably would of been about the same price and so.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W4|Probably the tea would of been better for us Small development that must that must be down there somewhere But you see practically anywhere here would be within Christopher's.

PS0W4|Oh there i there is new housing you know there's more.
PS0W2|Mm.
PS0W4|development er back there that's what made me think of it They wouldn't want to be near warehousing units of course but erm there's a lot of new building going on and with so much competition Thinking of Imelda for a job I mean there's there's loads of places here as well for her Exeter Hospital you know the Torbay Somebody mind you was on about Torbay this morning on the radio I think it was saying that there were so many complaints and nurses are under such great stress And I was very naughty I I felt like saying well some of their they them aren't er do you remember the very last time we were up in the hospital at the waiting area there was those two nurses that walked up and down.
PS0W2|Mm mm.
PS0W4|about five times doing nothing.
PS0W2|That's right.
PS0W4|So really and truly I mean it's not all nurses that are so stressed I'm sure there are some who are you know are in a bad way and they're having to do other things that they shouldn't be doing But this is the trouble with everybody these days isn't it.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W4|Everybody just wants to do what they should be doing whereas with my job it never even thought about it did we.
PS0W2|No no.
PS0W4|Tell you what erm when we get into you can just drop me down to the greengrocer near the church because I'm out of erm spring onions and if I wanted to add up to that bit of salad that we've got.

PS0W4|at the back of the houses there but erm There's that and then there's the new doctor's surgery.
PS0W2|Mm.
PS0W4|That's been pulled to bits in the erm press.
