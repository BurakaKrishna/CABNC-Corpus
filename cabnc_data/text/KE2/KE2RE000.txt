PS0W4|He might try and come down again.
PS0W3|What before.
PS0W4|before then but you know it depends.
PS0W3|Yeah.
PS0W4|cos he's this Friday he's taking a group erm youngsters to Paris.
PS0W3|Is he.
PS0W4|That had been booked you see before.
PS0W3|Yeah.
PS0W4|in fact he was also booked at Easter to go to the erm to Florence.
PS0W3|But he couldn't.
PS0W4|again but he's had to cancel that.
PS0W3|Yeah someone else has got to obviously in his place.
PS0W4|Either that or I'd imagine.
PS0W4|the people that went before have to sort of do it but as I say he wasn't er er.
PS0W4|we went up at dinner time on the next day and because he went back after he.
PS0W4|the morning again and we took Daniel up to the er cos there was a station Christopher picked him up there and off they went you see so erm haven't heard anything I presume he got back alright but as I say.
PS0W3|How's Carris taken all this anyway now.
PS0W4|Mm.
PS0W3|How's Carris taken all this now.
PS0W4|Well seemingly she's erm.
PS0W3|A bit resigned to it now.
PS0W4|a bit more resigned there's another there's another sort of erm possibility I mean if they sold their house quickly of course then you know they'd come down here obviously and they'd try and look for something but it's not likely that they'd sell their house that quickly.
PS0W3|No.
PS0W4|but if they did and.
PS0W3|They sell it.
PS0W4|you know they'd all come down but if they don't erm.
PS0W3|Christopher would travel.
PS0W4|possibility is that Marilyn would stay up there for another year with Carris you know in their house and Timothy of course and erm then sort of move down here.
PS0W3|What after Carris has done her er gcses.
PS0W4|I imagine so is she due to do them next year.
PS0W3|No she's not.
PS0W2|No she's not you see she's.
PS0W3|no.
PS0W2|got another year after that.
PS0W4|after that oh I thought she was.
PS0W3|I would of thought I would of thought is she if they're gon na move this year is the year she's def got ta do it.
PS0W4|Yeah well Christopher knows that.
PS0W3|Yeah.
PS0W4|but erm if everything else being equal obviously that would be the thing to do.
PS0W2|Yes that'd be me.
PS0W4|but if they can't well.
PS0W2|they won't want to be separated for.
PS0W4|well he.
PS0W3|twelve months.
PS0W2|twelve months or so.
PS0W4|He's going to be going up erm each weekend if this happens.
PS0W3|Oh yeah I mean that's that's the.
PS0W4|and erm Marilyn will come down of course when she's at she's worried as well about whether she's going to get a job cos er I mean they need to have erm a second income I should think.
PS0W3|Well yeah but I don't think the job's erm I mean that's not the problem for her because she can always go on the agency you see and she can do general midwifery.
PS0W4|Oh on the agency can you.
PS0W3|Oh yeah I mean I mean she can like.
PS0W3|she used to go to an old person's home of a night time you know.
PS0W4|Yeah.
PS0W3|or or days you can pick actually just when you want to do it.
PS0W2|Oh yeah that's what she'll get something.
PS0W3|she'll get paid she'll get paid travelling and everything for that so that er I don't see that that's erm.
PS0W4|No well that's probably erm.
PS0W3|no I don't think that's a problem.
PS0W4|no that's not a great consideration.
PS0W3|I I don't see that as a.
PS0W4|Well I think it's just.
PS0W3|I mean that could be a short term until she could get herself you know a full time regular post.
PS0W4|It's erm you know mostly Carris of course.
PS0W3|Yeah.
PS0W2|I mean I think if they can.
PS0W4|but she means if they sell their house they'll come down more every year then.
PS0W2|Yes because in the summer I mean you some time in the in this next term would be the ideal thing really because that if she can stay on for the summer term.
PS0W3|Before September that's right.
PS0W2|erm well most of it I mean she'll be take and erm.
PS0W3|Yes like in September.
PS0W4|Timothy.
PS0W2|Timothy will take his O levels you see during the summer term well I mean by the end of June he'd of finished those so that.
PS0W3|September would be the ideal time for erm you know to be starting down.
PS0W2|Well July August I mean any.
PS0W3|Well yeah.
PS0W4|To get settled in.
PS0W3|Yeah.
PS0W2|Mm.
PS0W4|but erm.
PS0W2|and.
PS0W4|as things are at the moment I think it.
PS0W3|But Chris.
PS0W4|Christopher's very much more happy to have met up with Bob in the office to see what he's you know the thoughts of.
PS0W3|Yeah he he'd come away I think rather happy I he he nev you know he begun to see here.
PS0W4|He's had some more idea he had no idea what be expected of him or anything.
PS0W3|Yeah.
PS0W4|and this Bob erm has sort he's been quite marvellous he's set up some fantastic things.
PS0W2|He's getting an O B E.
PS0W4|in.
PS0W3|Is he.
PS0W4|Yeah he's getting an O B E.
PS0W2|next.
PS0W4|next week isn't it.
PS0W2|next week or something yeah.
PS0W3|Is he.
PS0W4|And he's written books and all the rest of it and in fact he's he's going to be erm lecturing at Royal College.
PS0W3|Mm mm.
PS0W4|you know after he gets out from here on a temporary basis sort of thing so that erm Christopher says he's gon na be doing it for a year this lecturing but it's very nice for him because he'll be able to contact him and Bob will help him if it's necessary.
PS0W3|It'd be a difficult situation that will be for Chris then won't it I mean.
PS0W2|Well Chris says he's got ta keep in with him for a little while he said he.
PS0W3|Right.
PS0W2|he said I'd I'd I'd I'd rather have rather have him as a friend than an enemy.
PS0W3|And how did he get out of the Chris think he'd get on with him.
PS0W4|Oh very well.
PS0W2|Alright.
PS0W3|Was he on the panel on the board.
PS0W2|I don't think so no but you know I mean for six months if Christopher's living here and having to go back at the weekend for six months he gets an allowance.
PS0W4|A travelling allowance so.
PS0W3|Get it yeah.
PS0W4|that would save them.
PS0W3|yeah but what that doesn't take into account is the tiredness factor is it.
PS0W2|Oh no it doesn't.
PS0W3|Because you work you work the long days.
PS0W4|and go go by train.
PS0W3|He'll go back by train.
PS0W4|no question of Chris driving.
PS0W2|Go by train.
PS0W3|yeah but you've but you've actually got to do this I mean that's right.
PS0W2|I know it doesn't but at least it.
PS0W3|Yeah not.
PS0W3|fair enough yes and he gets moving allowance as well.
PS0W2|Yeah erm.
PS0W3|removal expenses.
PS0W4|So I mean it's.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W4|We don't know anything.
PS0W3|Oh no that's.
PS0W4|more than that nor does he really.
PS0W3|I haven't liked to phone him up because it you know I certainly don't want to be thought that yeah yeah try and be nosy or anything like that it erm.
PS0W4|But that I mean we didn't even know he was coming father rang up on erm.
PS0W2|It was ever so funny really.
PS0W4|Yeah because I had said to father during the day on Sunday I wonder if any of our children are alive Because we haven't heard or seen any of them or anybody.
PS0W3|Well I was I was at.
PS0W4|No I'm not talking.
PS0W2|Not you.

PS0W2|I said pardon.
PS0W2|he said well hasn't he told you I said what He said oh he says perhaps it was gon na be a surprise.
PS0W4|I've put my foot in it again.
PS0W2|perhaps I shouldn't of told you so I said well look Timothy I said this is a conversation that hasn't taken place I said when Christopher comes back in I said if you want to say anything you can but feel free not to and we'll just if he comes we won't know anything about it.
PS0W4|Play it by ear.
PS0W2|that that way he must of said something because Christopher phoned up and said I'm coming down tomorrow.
PS0W4|He did say something Christopher told me that.
PS0W2|Oh he did did he.
PS0W3|and I are off tomorrow and it's the first day off that we've had together you know for.

PS0W3|that's what I'd guessed erm so I said no I said they're fine so she said oh I'm ever so sorry I said don't be I said these sort of things get around I mean it's she kept go and then I went on to describe how I virtually done not too a dissimilar thing going up the road trying to talk to people about writing in to object you know with this planning application and erm I said I sort of knock on someone's door up there and I thought it was the next door that the husband had died and it was that one.
PS0W4|Oh dear.
PS0W2|Mm mm.
PS0W4|you can't help putting.
PS0W3|I'm going to go to the planning committee meeting there.
PS0W4|Are you.
PS0W3|on Monday and then happily leave around about teno'clock.
PS0W4|So you can go alright can you.
PS0W3|Oh yeah.
PS0W4|They'll they'll allow you to go.
PS0W3|Oh yeah you're allowed to go in and watch you're not allowed to say anything but I just wan na go in and and er.
PS0W2|See who says what.
PS0W3|Yeah.
PS0W2|Yeah that's a good idea mm.
PS0W4|Yes well I mean had we had any idea about this obviously father would of.
PS0W2|Didn't even go to the committee dear this one.
PS0W4|Didn't even no I've never even went to the committee yours was.
PS0W2|That was that was the trouble with ours.
PS0W4|going to a committee.
PS0W2|absolutely I'm sure of that.
PS0W3|Well I mean it's it's well as soon as it's well did you write in and object in within the time.
PS0W4|Oh yeah yes.
PS0W2|I wrote I wrote a foolscap letter with about nine points on it and somebody who the architect Chris's architect next door said with a letter like that going in it must go to the committee.
PS0W3|Mm.
PS0W2|so I wasn't bothered but it didn't go to the committee and now afterwards when I.
PS0W3|Mm.
PS0W2|then it was too late.
PS0W3|But you can't appeal against it you can't appeal against it.
PS0W2|No no.
PS0W4|No that's right.
PS0W3|they.
PS0W2|they can appeal.
PS0W3|they can appeal.
PS0W4|Yeah.
PS0W2|but you can't and I think it's very wrong that one man should have be almighty god really do.
PS0W4|This present mayor was away on holiday at the time he said perhaps that I should of seen that erm it would go to committee.
PS0W3|I mean I have gone to the trouble I have been in to see the planning officer that's dealing with it erm I've written to every single member of the planning committee I've written to the Environmental Health who have written back to me saying they offer no objections and there because the smell won't be a problem so I've written them back another stinking letter and saying well erm.
PS0W2|Come and live next door.
PS0W3|I I completely disagree with your thoughts on the fact that there won't be a smell so much so that the slightest smell if the if the er proposal gets the go ahead and I shall be on to your office and asking to speak to you personally to come and smell this erm.
PS0W4|And the rubbish I mean the the environmental people.
PS0W3|Oh they they say it's all controllable so that I've I've answered I haven't just let the Environmental Health wash over me I've actually written back to them again er I'll be interested to see whether I get a letter back from them but I phoned up the Council this morning and they're rejecting on two grounds one is to do with the highway and the sort of the traffic situation coming in there although the the authority the Highway Department aren't objecting to it and the other one is erm on local environmental issues I think you know that is is unsuitably unsuitable environmentally to the area well I can only say that I'm grateful to the planning to the planning offices for they're going out on a limb if you like because I think they're on thin ice erm and so long as the committee will will back them up I mean I don't know of what else I could of done as a person.
PS0W2|No nothing I don't think you could of done any more you got it to committee and and there's nothing more than you can do than that.
PS0W3|erm so that if if they then go to an appeal er I was talking to this planning officer and I was saying that I think I'll consult them he said I don't think you'll need to he said and of what you've done so far is pretty good and I can get access to all the letters that have been written in in objecting into the into the homes.
PS0W4|Have a lot of other people written in and objecting.
PS0W3|I think there's I think there's quite a few and I think this is what swayed it the fact that they have had erm I know of at least ten say ten there's one two three on the other side of the road which is good because Bob which is another one so that's four there's which is the other side of the shop is five there's us six Jean seven the eight erm the guy the other side of the which is nine there is Ginny over the and the erm old persons' home that's ten that I know of for certain about er and then I've heard of other people were gon na be writing in now whether they actually did or not I don't know.
PS0W4|Mm as you see you you really do need.
PS0W3|but I'm sure if if I've had ten objections I mean I've done.
PS0W2|You've done very well by that you know.
PS0W4|You really have been to houses.
PS0W2|I wish we of had that knowledge when.
PS0W4|Had we known about it because this is the sort of thing we could of gone.
PS0W2|We would of done the same sort of thing and could of gone in to see the planning officer but I just I just assumed you know that that life was fair but of course there's no justice in this life.
PS0W3|But er the only the only yes no the only other thing I would of said that you could of perhaps done would be go to to a Local Authority ombudsman.
PS0W2|Well I we went there afterwards.
PS0W3|Did you and what did he say.
PS0W2|but it was too late you see and there was no I mean.
PS0W4|It was passed.
PS0W2|I I couldn't produce any evidence of malpractice I mean I could.
PS0W3|No.
PS0W2|think what I'd like but I couldn't prove anything and erm so there was nothing that the ombudsman could do at that stage at as the stage complete.
PS0W3|Yeah.
PS0W2|erm and there was nothing that a Member of Parliament could do this is the trouble I mean it it with everybody was saying you should of contacted us before it went to.
PS0W3|I'm going to see Patrick tomorrow there's a coffee morning up in the village but erm.
PS0W4|Well you went to see him.
PS0W2|and he he is very keen to try and change the law so that people like you and I who is.
PS0W3|can appeal.
PS0W2|can can appeal against the decision which goes against us it's its not fair that we.
PS0W3|because we we're the third party we're not allowed to appeal against it.
PS0W2|It's not fair that the the other people.
PS0W3|I know.
PS0W2|can appeal but you can't.
PS0W3|I know the person whose house I mean I've spoken to Jane at some length and I'll probably ring her tonight erm but erm I I might go around and see old erm tomorrow at a coffee morning I think up in the village.
PS0W4|But I think that he I find he's.
PS0W2|Anything he does.
PS0W4|he's very sympathetic to the likes of.
PS0W2|at least at least you've got it's going to committee it's not gon na be just on the on the rest on one man.
PS0W4|One person with er yeah.
PS0W2|erm who will undoubtedly he'll have favourable contacts with the person who was applying.
PS0W3|I mean as I'm I don't think they had any option with this I think because it's a change of usage considerable change of use then it had to go before the committee erm but erm.
PS0W4|It's okay even if they get send down then of course they can still appeal but you can't it's ridiculous.
PS0W2|Well it's not fair.
PS0W4|No.
PS0W3|That's right and so I don't know we erm we live in hopes anyway.
PS0W2|And how's Helen.
PS0W3|Alright I mean she's working long and hard and er.
PS0W2|How does she think she'll do with her A levels.
PS0W3|Well I think.
PS0W2|Has she had her mocks yet.
PS0W3|No not yet she's she's had an accept I'm taking her up to Cardiff on Wednesday on a B and two Cs the thing.
PS0W4|Yeah.
PS0W2|Oh for going to university.
PS0W3|Yeah.
PS0W4|What about her er York which she's had.
PS0W3|She hasn't heard from York she's heard from Leicester.
PS0W4|She hasn't heard from them yet.
PS0W3|and she's got an acceptance from them on a B and two Cs.
PS0W4|Oh has she.
PS0W3|erm.
PS0W4|Because it was York that was stopping her listing wasn't it.
PS0W2|What she going to what she applying to get a degree.
PS0W3|History.
PS0W2|History.
PS0W3|The trouble is I mean I can take I can take her up to Bristol er Cardiff next week but there's another thing to to Leicester and I can't get her up to Leicester although she.
PS0W3|on a train because I've got a governor's meeting that day and and I can't avoid not being at that governor's meeting because I'm a chairman.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W3|of the building and sites.
PS0W4|Yeah.
PS0W3|erm ha I du n no.
PS0W2|When is it for Leicester.
PS0W3|Do you know I can't remember the date early part of March early part of March erm what she says at the moment is that er someone else from the college is going to Leicester next Wednesday when Helen's going to Cardiff and this girl is then going to Cardiff when Helen should be going to Leicester so Helen says and she wants to look at the same subjects as what Helen does so Helen says that they're gon na sort of go to the different colleges and compare notes when they come back from it so she might needn't want to go to Leicester.
PS0W4|Mm.
PS0W3|erm so I just I just don't know erm so we just.
PS0W4|Daniel was saying hasn't she heard from any of her.
PS0W3|so.
PS0W4|I said I don't honestly I only know that er erm.
PS0W3|which is quite nice to have fir to have an acceptance to anyway.
PS0W4|Yeah very good.
PS0W3|so I don't think she'll get an acceptance to York on a B and two Cs I think York is one of the better.
PS0W4|Try thinking do you know somebody used.
PS0W3|better I think.
PS0W4|to swear about Southampton for history.
PS0W3|I don't know I can't remember whether she applied for that I know Harold his daughter went up to Southampton and he was horrified at the accommodation she was staying in up there.
PS0W4|But I know that erm for.
PS0W3|I think I've just about finished with it.
PS0W4|Oh have you.
PS0W2|Have you We've not had an appointment to go back have we since you've been home but I suppose it was been October when we went.
PS0W3|I've had I've had two hundred pounds worth I've given her a cheque for two hundred pounds.
PS0W2|Have you really What on earth have they done.
PS0W4|well he had all sorts of.
PS0W3|I've had two two three crowns.
PS0W2|That's only fifteen shillings.
PS0W3|I've had a new plate I've had a hell of a lot with with a one of the.
PS0W3|something to one of the teeth.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W3|crown dropped off so she had to put that back on she never put I had to get erm have another fitting for it because she said the purpose of pins in her teeth in the tooth to try and get the crown to sit on on the pins erm.
PS0W2|Darling.
PS0W4|Er I know he's he's told me.
PS0W3|and in fact.
PS0W4|last time I saw him.
PS0W3|I took I took the cheque around on Monday I had the the last appointment on Friday and erm since I've had the abscess the tooth that's got a crown on top I think it's been pushed up a little bit and my top teeth the first two keeps catching was this.
PS0W3|well it never has done I mean that it's always been like that I've never had.
PS0W3|erm I can put together.
PS0W4|It's naughty of your mother not to let you have them.
PS0W3|Oh but this it was catching the tooth that had the abscessing underneath it.

PS0W2|up there.
PS0W3|Yeah what did he say.
PS0W2|Oh I think he was just surprised I don't think he knew you know I mean.

PS0W2|He's erm.
PS0W4|Kay knows him cos he's.
PS0W2|he's about I suppose he's about my height probably slightly slimmer.
PS0W4|Slimmer.

PS0W2|He's got he's got a big a very big scout badge on his lapel.
PS0W4|And he had a scout badge on his tie did you notice that.

PS0W4|Kay knew him she rang him up.
PS0W3|Well I mean if it if it's if it's ten.
PS0W3|erm I'm at the process of now looking to spend certainly four hundred pound on a tent and maybe.
PS0W2|Well I I I mean I wouldn't of thought that.
PS0W4|Your your best bet would be to go up and sort of you know look at the tents that are up there so that you would know whether they went about.
PS0W2|I'm meeting him nineo'clock Tuesday morning at the hall.
PS0W4|But I suppose you could go and look tomorrow morning.
PS0W3|I'm at work erm well.
PS0W4|he's off tomorrow.
PS0W3|erm I well I can't commit myself to going down to that to I mean if it's if I can I'll give you a ring because with Cherry being off as well it's I mean it's gon na be unfair if I start cos I've been so much.
PS0W2|Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
PS0W4|but if if you are going to be spending a whole lot of money on tents and if these were any good.
PS0W3|Well I mean it's this it's patrol it's two patrol tents in particular that I'm looking at if they've got some decent er scout tents.
PS0W2|I must say I mean I I mean er there were two rolls.
PS0W3|How big are the rolls.
PS0W2|Well I don't think they're big enough for a big tent I mean one is fairly long but er I don't.
PS0W4|But do would it be.
PS0W2|it wouldn't be any thicker than that I don't suppose but I mean I wouldn't know.
PS0W3|No that.
PS0W4|The thing about it is.
PS0W2|It it I wouldn't of thought.
PS0W3|Perhaps that doesn't sound like a patrol tent.
PS0W2|No it doesn't sound like a patrol tent.
PS0W4|This er I know Margaret Margaret erm what's her name.
PS0W4|at the time no it's I won't say.
PS0W4|Tina's daughter.
PS0W3|I know.
PS0W4|Jim's daughter.
PS0W3|Yes.
PS0W4|Marcus and all them.
PS0W3|Yes.
PS0W4|kids are called.
PS0W4|that's right erm she had said at the time when they had raised all this money that er mostly gon na be spent on erm.
PS0W3|Tents.
PS0W2|Camping equipment.
PS0W4|tents and camping equipment so that.
PS0W3|I can find out anyway because I can always talk to Andre about it he'll know er what's being done about it erm.
PS0W2|Er anyway he this fellow's gon na we're going to clear all the rubbish.
PS0W4|So they they they've dropped the erm the group altogether then.
PS0W3|Yes and the.
PS0W4|Who else would that involve.
PS0W3|Well there was an adventure section as well.
PS0W4|Oh was there.
PS0W3|erm the adventure section was quite successful in a lot of respects they had quite a few people er attached to it the scout group and the cub group cub packs didn't have very many but erm the adventure section had quite a few people er and in fact we've got people doing the tent stalls at the moment that are from a seventh mutant which is what it was and of course they've disenfranchised if you like er but we're looking the district is looking to create a new group with Buckland.
PS0W4|Yeah.
PS0W3|so instead of being the seventh Saint Joseph's we'd be just erm Newton Abbott.
PS0W4|Yeah.
PS0W3|so the seventh will stay.
PS0W4|Mm mm.
PS0W3|and because the Buckinary is so big and really warrants having a stag group over that neck of the woods.
PS0W4|They could well do.
PS0W3|they are gon na try and hang onto this seventh so it well might be.
PS0W4|Resurrected.
PS0W3|that all its equipment is gon na be held on to.
PS0W4|Yeah.
PS0W3|to try and set up a scout group.
PS0W4|But in it it's wicked in that in that cupboard they've got two pairs of really good walking boots when Kay saw them she said it's not their feet because you see she had the cubs there right from the beginning.
PS0W3|Mum we have got the ten saws last year one of the lads left with us a pair of eighty pound boots and fifty pound gaiters left them and we don't know who they belong to.
PS0W4|Ain't it awful really.
PS0W3|the scarper boots you know with the yeti gaiters on.
PS0W4|Yeah.
PS0W3|and the yeti gaiters are fifty pounds.
PS0W4|Gosh.
PS0W3|fifty five pounds.
PS0W4|But anyway.
PS0W3|and the and and and the and the scarper boots.
PS0W4|he was he was so horrified about it because she had actually run all that right from the beginning.
PS0W2|That came in this morning.
PS0W4|Yeah I was gon na give you a ring to say it's been this way pick them up.
PS0W4|we had a piece for lunch and erm.
