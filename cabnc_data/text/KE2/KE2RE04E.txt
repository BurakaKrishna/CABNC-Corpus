PS0W5|It had Steve Martin in it it's a comedy.
PS0W2|Yeah.
PS0W5|it's called Father of the Bride and it's about this wedding kind of thing.
PS0W2|Oh er I I have to plead my ignorance I don't even know who Steve Martin is Well how can we help today.
PS0W5|I finished this book.
PS0W2|Did you.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|Good so let's see what you did who did you go to the pictures with.
PS0W5|Oh my friend Emma.
PS0W2|Emma So where did you go from here.
PS0W5|Yeah where it starts in the pen.
PS0W2|Where it starts in the pen mm what was it Right right so let us see what we can do shall we Erm where do we start.
PS0W5|I need a.
PS0W2|there yeah.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|E two now you've got to work out the average speed right try and think roughly what the answer would be because if you thought of that then you would know that's a silly answer cos look how far is the journey.
PS0W5|A hundred and twenty miles.
PS0W2|Right well say a nice you know just to the nearest to the nearest erm whole number.
PS0W5|A hundred.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|and twenty seven miles.
PS0W2|A hundred and twenty seven what's that to the nearest hour.
PS0W5|Two hours.
PS0W2|Right so if it goes say a hundred and twenty six miles or a hundred and twenty miles to the nearest ten miles it goes a hundred and twenty miles in two hours how far would it go in one hour.
PS0W5|Sixty.
PS0W2|Right sixty so that can't be right can it Right so how are you gon na find the average speed what do you do to find that average speed You divide what by what.
PS0W5|Divide that by that.
PS0W2|Right but what are you gon na divide that by on a calculator.
PS0W5|Two point twelve.
PS0W2|No this is the whole thing isn't it Don't you remember look if there were a hundred minutes in an hour that would be two point one two but there's not a hundred minutes in an hour are there How many minutes are there in an hour.
PS0W5|Sixty.
PS0W2|Right now look it says there so what's twelve minutes.
PS0W5|Nought point two.
PS0W2|Right so what are you gon na divide that by to get the average speed.
PS0W5|Twelve point two.
PS0W2|No.
PS0W5|Nought point.
PS0W2|what's the time.
PS0W5|Erm two hours and twelve minutes.
PS0W2|Right how do you write that as a decimal of an hour What's two hours twelve minutes Look you've got two hours and you've got twelve minutes now what fraction of an hour is twelve minutes.
PS0W5|Erm five.
PS0W2|No what twelve minutes is what fraction of an hour.
PS0W5|Oh nought point two.
PS0W2|Right so that equals the minutes is point two how many hours.
PS0W5|Two.
PS0W2|So two hours twelve minutes is two point two.
PS0W5|Two.
PS0W2|hours.
PS0W5|Yeah.
PS0W2|Right so to find the average speed what you gon na do.
PS0W5|Two hours divided by.
PS0W2|Right but and what that by.
PS0W5|That divide by that.
PS0W2|divide come on say again.
PS0W5|That.
PS0W2|That by by what.
PS0W5|Two point two.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Fifty eight.
PS0W2|That's right right well what about the next one.
PS0W5|Doesn't say.
PS0W2|Well how many minutes is it.
PS0W5|Nought point nine five.
PS0W5|nought point nine five.
PS0W2|Where does fifty eight come.
PS0W5|There.
PS0W2|Does it.
PS0W5|No.
PS0W2|Right there so what are you gon na divide it by.
PS0W5|Mm.
PS0W2|That's nought point eight nought point nine nought point nine five nought point nine.
PS0W5|Six.
PS0W2|six and that's half way to it so that's nought point nine six five.
PS0W5|Five.
PS0W2|Look nought point nine six five and so you're gon na divide.
PS0W5|Five.
PS0W2|you're gon na divide fifty point five by.
PS0W5|Fifty two.
PS0W2|Right right now D.
PS0W5|Well that one point two.
PS0W2|That's right.
PS0W5|forty two.
PS0W2|Right right now the next one.
PS0W5|Er how you gon na take it out of it Three at thirty nine.
PS0W5|thirty nine.
PS0W2|So what is it.
PS0W5|Two hours thirty nine minutes.
PS0W2|Right two hours thirty nine right.
PS0W5|Two point six five.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|Seventy two.
PS0W2|Right.
PS0W5|I've got erm how many hours and all this written down at home if you want me to bring that up.
PS0W2|Erm.
PS0W5|write all the hours down.
PS0W2|Yes you can do.
