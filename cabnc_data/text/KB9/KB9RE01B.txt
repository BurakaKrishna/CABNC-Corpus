PS1KS|We have a a weird system how it works and I've got my hands tied behind my back erm if you're on with fasteners you can't use Power Tools.
PS1D1|No.
PS1KS|Until I break free and go into my unit.
PS1D1|Yeah.
PS1KS|Alright So but there again if I get the enquiries fas I mean that obviously is the enquiry came through to me so obviously I quoted on it but.
PS1D1|Yeah.
PS1KS|anything like nuts and bolts fixings fasteners that type of thing go has to go through the.
PS1CX|They only stop them cos I hang on to choice int draw.
PS1KS|Well it's.
PS1KS|The thing is because of the profit margin I mean.
PS1D1|If there's a Cumbrian Fasteners one in there give it take it back.
PS1KS|Because of the profit we're.
PS1KS|we're making on the hand tools things like that er works with our account money cos you get a thirty day account So if you go on thirty days unfortunately we we'll enforce that.
PS1CX|Yeah.
PS1KS|Nothing personal.
PS1CX|Tha that's erm yeah this is.
PS1D1|Well they haven't done it that with us we've been on the thirty days and just no.
PS1KS|Well our fasteners in they might allow you to go to forty five days.
PS1D1|Well what she normally does.
PS1CX|Could of given you.
PS1D1|I've said to her it's.

PS1D1|Just gives us a ring and say have you got your cheque And I said yeah and I drop it into her now It's normally me that forgets to er.
PS1CX|What what I try to do I just hang on to them till somebody shouts.
PS1D1|Well tha that's what a lot of people do You've got to.
PS1CX|Because erm.
PS1D1|You've got to wait for your money haven't you.
PS1CX|well we're finding that out When we first started.
PS1CX|I used to pay them straight away but the big companies aren't paying us.
PS1KS|No.
PS1D1|We found the same.
PS1CX|And er it's just chronic So hopefully they're gon na stop that.

PS1D1|and he's never had a better job than what he had at Widnes I'll tell you.
PS1KS|Yeah a mere pittance of pay Twenty two pound.
PS1KS|for a forty seven hour week.
PS1D1|Oh You go that one there Forty five quid she's she's gon na be only doing sixty seventy hours a week.
PS1CX|Forty five quid.

PS1KS|Shee.
PS1D1|I just said to her you know just tell them.
PS1KS|Not worth getting out of bed.
PS1D1|you know just ask them if there's any more money in it if she works the long hours.
PS1CY|The trouble is.
PS1KS|Well if I go on the premises work with me and he's trained like you had one for Steven.
PS1D1|Well we've got one here.
PS1KS|Yeah.
PS1CY|Yeah.
PS1D1|And I've just as a basic figure I mean they give up to a certain figure o before their hours you put a bit of tax and after that but er we've allocated him to work in the afternoons when I'm out they allocate to her the warehouse because I can't afford any er as I say they repairs a machine it goes out faulty and the onus is on me and the company.
PS1KS|Yeah.
PS1D1|and he ha he hasn't been trained up fully yet so he you know but plus the course he's on at er college isn't doing him any good.
PS1KS|That's what happened to our drill you see you've had apprentice on it.
PS1D1|You're right.
PS1D1|I've I failed miserably so I thought I've had to put the apprentice on it you see No it er.
PS1KS|Things can only get worse then.
PS1D1|Probably.
PS1KS|I gi him general things on their own I mean it's it's really quiet I mean I as a company Cumbria Power Tools will always you know it will survive because there's only me and this.
PS1CY|Oh yeah.
PS1KS|this there But er it it didn't take a lot to keep me busy But fasteners I mean you know I mean things are.
PS1CY|You're not having this.
PS1KS|are struggling we've had a couple of.

PS1D1|The only trouble that a lot of people I think Cumbria Fasteners in one respect.
PS1CX|Shall I do it now.
PS1CY|Yeah.
PS1D1|would get if they got their act together.
PS1CY|And see what's happening.
PS1D1|they would have a lot more customers whatever the price.
PS1CY|Cos you want to get cracking don't you.
PS1CX|Yeah.
PS1D1|The they lose a lot of customers er to to other people that sometimes charge them more And we get pissed off with Cumbria.
PS1CX|Yeah.
