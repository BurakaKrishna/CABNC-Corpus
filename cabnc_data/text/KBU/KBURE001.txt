PS18E|I could just sleep Just feel like I'm not learning anything.
KBUPSUN|I know But then the thing is.

KBUPSUN|so I'm not learning anything and then we're to.
PS18L|What have I done all day.
PS18E|I know what.
PS18K|in the past two days.
PS18E|It's like what I said to Tony last night when I got in I said I feel I could have achieved more if I'd stayed at home and revised.
PS18K|Yeah I could of.
PS18E|He said but yo you wouldn't of I said well I would of that's the whole point I would have revised all afternoon.
PS18L|I know Anne was saying when.
PS18L|Anne.
PS18L|she was revising.
PS18L|I've never seen.
PS18L|No that was right.
PS18L|The whole.
PS18L|Sorry I didn't offer anybody cos.
PS18K|No that's alright.
PS18L|Oh And I when she's revising she says oh I've just done about change and theories of change.
PS18K|Who.
PS18L|Theories of change.
PS18E|But we started with Fred and only got.
PS18L|Have you remembered that.
PS18E|a third of a ye way through it.
PS18L|Change in the N H S Change do you know what change she's talking about Freezing something when er a liquid is freezing and it changes when it is you know changes in the physical sense of the.
PS18E|Yeah.
PS18L|word That's what they learn about I said oh that's what I've got then Cos I'm talking about change in the N H S is all we can put down.
PS18K|Here's Anne.
PS18L|But then it's just how bad it.
PS18E|Oh I wish we'd just done that.
PS18L|It's so simplified So basic so logic I mean what do we need about planning something We don't need it.
PS18K|I mean I didn't understand much to be honest anyway.
PS18E|I wasn't listening cos I was writing them down.
PS18L|The thing is with this I don't think half the people listen to you're meant to know you're meant to in these exams you're meant to have everything you should know and everything else.
PS18E|That's it I'm sitting writing notes and I'm thinking am I ever gon na look at these again Cos every time I have an exam it's a exactly the same things.
PS18K|I have got revision cards coming out of my ears And erm which I'll never look at again at all.
PS18E|We're all looking very sorry for ourselves.
PS18L|Well what relevance is it to me Is not.
PS18K|I know.
PS18L|I'm not gon na be a nurse anyway.
PS18K|And I'm gon na go away next next weekend aren't I.

PS18L|Mm.
PS18E|He says it's very unusual you never see me like this Ooh I quite fancy doing that.
PS18H|We should have done.
PS18E|You know I was thinking today.
PS18E|I was thinking today erm there's a horse.
PS18L|Sorry Say that again.
PS18E|there's a horse erm in some of the fields just coming out of Morpeth towards Newcastle and I saw pardon me as I was on the bus like yesterday coming into Morpeth and this horse just shot out of nowhere and it was really enjoying itself It was like galloping along.
PS18L|as if it was racing Yeah.
PS18E|Yeah It was just like this.
PS18E|And then it thing and it came it was really galloping towards the fence and then cor Right up.
PS18L|Yeah.
PS18E|to the fence It stuck a.
PS18L|All of a sudden.
PS18E|And I was looking I was thinking oh To be free like that.
PS18L|Mm.
PS18E|And then today when I was passing it was just munching away in the corner you know And I was thinking tt it must nice Alison's got a hobby she can just go out and you know do it to get away.
PS18K|Shall I tell you what it is sometimes.
PS18E|from everything.
PS18K|I go back from I'm driving over to Brenda's and I'm thinking and I really am I'm driving along you know like wha when you're in the car by yourself and everything's turning over in your head.
PS18E|Mm.
PS18K|and go and I tack up the horse and I get on the horse and everything and I don't mean to say.
PS18E|Falls away.
PS18K|I'm drifting through the countryside cos.
PS18E|No.
PS18K|it might be and I'll go over the level crossing I'll think ooh that was a bit.
PS18K|you know things like that and then we'll see another horse in the field and Canter goes ooh ooh.
PS18K|it's all so everything.
PS18E|Mm.
PS18K|it's it's it's on a different level it really is And because you could you could just like ride away and not come back ever Even when you come back.
PS18K|you feel much better You feel oh I really enjoyed that And it's a different kind of enjoyment but I mean I've never played squash.
PS18E|Do you feel like that when you run.
PS18L|Well well it must be the same.
PS18K|Or like when I if I we say maybe now I can't imagine feeling like that except with horse riding but I suppose you do whatever your thing is.
PS18E|That's it It is Er I wish I had a hobby or a outside interest.
PS18K|It has to be outside I think Definitely.
KBUPSUN|Yeah.
PS18K|Outside outside.
KBUPSUN|That's it I suppose.
PS18K|Suppose like the riding.
KBUPSUN|everyone feels like that.
PS18K|I think I would I think I feel like that everything will still be there while I was riding along.
KBUPSUN|Oh.
PS18K|I have to stop and think about it but I.
PS18E|You know what your natural endorphin would come to the surface and you just start getting the feeling of.
KBUPSUN|Well that's the thing like it's.
PS18E|You come to solutions and conclusions and everything's right with the world And we'd better go back now.
PS18K|If you twitched a horses lip or ear that happens I would really like to see if I twitched your ear.
PS18L|And can we get a.
PS18E|Well.
KBUPSUN|Yeah Mm.

PS18L|To achieve this quality assurance should mean that when the patient feels his care is not good he should know how he can complain without any worry that he will be penalized and in the certainty that action will be taken immediately And that's these things here There's patient questionnaires complaints da da er ba la visitor inspections complaints patient questionnaire there's a basically all the same kind of thing or relative survey Patient questionnaire So basically what they're saying there's all these things that they'll provide at each stage of his journey so that if care isn't right he knows what channels to go through to complain My criticism of that being is.
PS18L|But what if it's not carried out.
PS18L|it's it's al the quality's not there to start with How can you.
PS18J|He da he won't know what what quality of care is though.
PS18L|Well er the patient has his views about what.
PS18J|Yeah.
PS18L|he expects good nursing care.
PS18J|But his views aren't really gon na be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot of people wouldn't know.
PS18L|No everybody's individual And to get what it says here to get quality assurance the patient's views and the 's views have to be in agreement What say you're the and I'm the.
PS18J|Yeah.
PS18L|patient what I think is good nursing care might not be what you think is good nursing care.
PS18J|But what you know is not gon na be the same.
PS18L|It has to be the same for quality assurance.
PS18J|But it's not gon na be the same.
PS18M|But that will.
PS18L|Yeah cos you.
PS18M|I tell you what I think.
PS18E|It says on our research thing.
PS18M|say that say that erm.
PS18M|Say that.
PS18L|Er say yes to that one.
PS18E|I shan't ask anything.
PS18M|But will it tell me the truth.
PS18H|Well see for one is she's not erm as bad as that You know some patients I could think of seem to have the idea that everything should be done for them in hospital.
PS18L|Mm.
PS18H|and that to them is good care if a nurse does everything for them but it's not If you're taking all.
PS18L|Yeah.
PS18E|Mm.
PS18E|And when he goes into.
PS18H|Plus they also say that a nurse is always.
PS18H|busy and they're angels and they're that and the other that they won't complain.
PS18L|Well that's the only way that this can be assessed is by so that the patient blah blah la when a patient feels his care is not good he knows he can complain without any worry But complaining I mean if he's got ta complain it means that quality assurance isn't there.
PS18J|But.
PS18L|This is only thing if they've got something to complain about.
PS18J|if you were the patient nurse.
PS18H|So there's nothing to actually say.
PS18L|In a positive sense.
PS18H|Yeah.
PS18J|Yeah.
PS18L|The only thing that.
PS18H|So if it.
PS18L|says.
PS18H|Yeah.
PS18L|erm meaning ha blah blah and action taken It should also mean that when Mr that's it says the nurses were marvellous the nurses are able to say in all evidence and with evidence to support their opinion yes.
PS18E|We were crap.
PS18L|we are really doing a pretty good job.
PS18L|That's all it says in a positi from a positive angle.
PS18H|Yeah but.
KBUPSUN|A pretty good job.
PS18L|So what do you think.
PS18E|But like if you take like.
PS18E|like er le let me if you were the patient and Lesley was the nurse like you wouldn't have a clue whether it was er.
PS18H|Exactly.
PS18E|good or not because as long as it was pretty clean.
PS18L|Let's have a look what examples they're using.
PS18H|Well that's what I was trying to say because all the patient doesn't know what to expect anyway.
PS18L|I mean the patient wouldn't know whether it was like clean.
PS18L|Well these are the criteria leaves for tests and investigations for tests and investigations for example good facilities working equipment nice staff competent qualified staff.
PS18M|Well I'm not nice.
PS18L|written and verbal information appropriate tests no complications But not necessarily the procedure itself If you if you were the patient you might say it's wrong because erm she doesn't look like she knows what she's doing or there's a mistake or something gets missed.
PS18E|Yeah.
PS18L|You know.
PS18M|But I mean on that well I think it's.
PS18E|Well I think the whole point of it is.
PS18M|erm the patient's not gon na know that I'm first of all not gon na know anything about nurses.
KBUPSUN|Yeah.
PS18M|Because he didn't he stayed cos they class him as an A person.
PS18L|And he might take a personal dislike to one of nurses.
PS18L|Yeah.
PS18E|They can only evaluate the care that they've had.
PS18E|can't they At the end of their stay Whether they they feel they feel better and whether that's because the nurses have done a good job or not.
KBUPSUN|So ideally er.
PS18E|Nurses can they can only they can only say evaluate a certain proportion of the erm.
PS18M|Yeah.
PS18E|things in question.
PS18L|Well it says for the nurses to is to be able to evaluate Waiting list monitoring outpatient department review observation visits erm nursing audit medical audit care review qualifications check.
PS18M|Well you see the bit about the waiting.
PS18L|You know it's all very.
PS18M|list right.
PS18L|Mm.
PS18M|That's one thing here will get them in and out but I've spoken to patients who say they don't get the care here and on the surface it looks a brilliant hospital it gets them in and out you know it does everything it's got all the facilities but it doesn't give them the care.
PS18L|Mm I think the biggest.
PS18L|bogey is is where.
PS18M|That's right.
PS18L|it says quality can only be assured if both patient's view and 's view are in agreement cos that's gon na be really hard to achieve isn't it.
KBUPSUN|Yeah.
PS18L|Where's it say that Make sure I've written it down.
PS18E|Yes but quality doesn't just co erm take into account the care that's given it takes into erm what equipment you've got on whether th er the equipment's used properly.
PS18H|I mean but that that is what I was pointing out and we have some say you have somebody qualified to go and visit each patient.
PS18E|What the hell's a.
PS18H|even just to like I feel we're doing the research do you know what I mean.
KBUPSUN|Mhm.
PS18L|Mm.
PS18L|Yeah I will say that.
PS18M|What about yours Neil.
PS18L|Come on Neily.
PS18E|Hang on I've lost my my work.
PS18L|back too soon.
PS18E|That's wishful thinking.
PS18E|Wears my out.
PS18E|I've got my husband's on.
PS18J|What.
PS18E|Socks.
PS18J|Not the same ones as yesterday.
PS18E|No I've got about five no I've got about four pairs the same Two pairs of blue and two pairs of red.
PS18J|You mean your husband's got four pairs.
PS18E|Well Mm.
PS18E|Right My art.
PS18E|Thirteen centre.
PS18E|My.
PS18E|Sorry.
PS18E|my article's about raising the standards of health care in the hospitals It's all the same really And it it looks upon nurses feel about their own standard of care and the article then goes on about.
PS18E|Standard they provide.
PS18E|standard they provide for.
PS18E|Mm.
PS18E|the patients And then the it goes on about setting up the single but dynamic standards a setting system it's called divided into local level groups like a tier system you get the Managing Director on the top and the ones at the bottom And they're called quality assurance or standard setting teams made up of volunteers.
PS18E|from the local wards The main base made up of volunteers from the local wards like nurses and well I mean nurses and auxiliaries like that But it's bring it says things about care and assessing that quality care's being met on their ward and the hospital itself and about once every six months to meet up with.
PS18E|other hos members of other hospitals in the area and discuss different aspects of raising the standards of care.
PS18E|And the introduction about about care is passed up the three tiers like a triangular system's.
PS18L|Mm.
PS18E|passed up a three tier system And if the ideas are good then er incorporated into the care they're incorporated into the hospital's manifesto if you want if you like But there's one one fault really it takes approximately fifteen to eighteen months for them to pass anything like that and that could be one.
PS18E|Downfall.
PS18E|downfall one criticism about.
PS18M|Yeah cos this one says it's immediate.
PS18E|Yeah Well this one takes fifteen to eighteen months and that's to me that's just ridiculous really.
PS18E|And then it would take another however to implement any changes that they decided upon.
PS18L|Basically they they just provide the ideas which get passed.
PS18E|They provide the er.
PS18L|to the top of the ladder.
PS18E|That's it.
PS18L|and then.
PS18E|And they're the ones in the situation so they get pa they're the ones who are actually on the ward at the bottom and then pass it up It's like.
KBUPSUN|Yeah.
PS18E|being in parliament really you have to pass everything up.
PS18E|Well the thing is though people at the top don't necessarily see the problems that you see as problems.
PS18E|No they don't no.
PS18E|as being problems do they.
PS18E|That's probably why it takes fifteen to eighteen months to get a a result.
PS18L|To get there.
PS18L|It's not gon na help the patient like at the time like at the time if your patient complains something will be done.
PS18J|What happens there and then.
PS18L|If your patient complained like I du n no.
PS18E|Probably be dead by the time.
KBUPSUN|Gone out the window.
PS18E|Yeah.
PS18E|What if you've got a loved one.
PS18L|And and we sort of no yours doesn't necessarily apply to some people to say they might just think oh it'll be.
PS18E|I know.
PS18L|good idea to.
PS18E|Just what you think.
PS18E|Yes by the time it comes to getting round to your complaint you've moved on.
PS18L|Mm mm.
PS18M|It's unbelievable how many they.
PS18E|So is that it basically.
PS18E|If you want to call an issue but I was on about setting up these committees to assess the standard of care.
PS18L|I've got a bit like that and says the erm quality assurance systems will have to be different in each health district with like being variations But it says it has identified key elements and one of those elements is a Director of Quality Assurance should.
PS18E|Yeah.
PS18L|be appointed with responsibility for setting up the programme She would receive minutes of all meetings and have the right to attend these meetings to provide a quality assurance input So that's the same.
PS18E|And like I must have got the er the review board should be er six six requirements for these groups.
PS18L|Mm mm.
PS18E|They must voluntary to the whole.
PS18L|Right.
PS18E|Erm there must be more than six people There must be a meeting once every three or four weeks for one and a half hours And the meeting should be held in a place where it is possible to work in our situation And a leader should be appointed.
PS18L|Yeah.
PS18E|Yeah but even with all those things in their favour it still takes fifteen months.
PS18E|It still takes fifteen to eighteen months to deliver to pass.
PS18E|But the leaders are nearly always someone like a Director of Nursing or somebody like that who has no ward experience.
PS18M|But you need somebody higher up.
PS18E|on a day to day.
PS18M|to be able to pass these bills doesn't it To be able to pass the.
PS18J|yeah try to get them to pass it.
PS18M|Right.
PS18J|It can not be get background.
PS18M|Mhm.
PS18E|Mm.
PS18J|So the major criticism for that is higher.
PS18L|Is up.
PS18E|Fifteen.
PS18J|up.
PS18L|high.
PS18E|to eighteen months.
KBUPSUN|Lyndsey.
PS18E|Fifteen months minimum.
PS18L|I think I had it once before.
KBUPSUN|What.
PS18L|I just you know I'm not sure.
PS18L|I know.
PS18E|I think so.
PS18J|Well when you've got five minutes come and knock's door.
PS18L|Well as long as you know about yours and then when she does direct the question at you about that particular.
PS18J|Shall I tell you what mine's about.
PS18E|Well I've told you what mine's about.
PS18J|Shut up You're gon na get this too.
PS18E|Mm mm.
PS18J|It's about a two different tools.
PS18E|A tool being.
PS18L|My body is my tool.
PS18J|Whatever you like.
PS18J|One's called the monitor and one's called called the system There you are.
PS18E|That's all we need to know is it Right.
PS18J|Well you could even call it a system Somewhere.
PS18E|Can we go home now We may as well get cracking with research mightn't we.
PS18L|Well we're waiting for these lot.
PS18L|Ah.
PS18J|Can we start when the others come back.
PS18N|Sure can.
PS18E|Can we start now.
PS18E|Why have we covered before the others come back.
PS18L|Then we'll get out five minutes early and we'll see a bit more of Eastenders.
