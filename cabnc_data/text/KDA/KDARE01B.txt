PS1GJ|They was taking those skirts.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|Yeah.
PS1GE|And they whipped the the skirts off.
PS1GJ|Because they were both nice women weren't they.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|Cheryl Cheryl Baker and.
PS1GE|Oh god.
PS1GJ|the other one left didn't she.
PS1GE|Yeah Quite quite a bit of disgrace actually cos she was having an affair with er the tour manager wasn't she.
PS1GJ|Something like that And they were both weren't he married or something.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|I thought she was the tasty one as well.
PS1GE|Cor yeah.

PS1GE|Excuse me.
PS1GJ|Yeah they went into an upbeat time didn't they They ripped loads of people off.
PS1GE|Yeah Actually they they were quite good They weren't bad anyway.
PS1GJ|Oh I I would certainly reckon that was the best song on there for two or three years And and after as well.
PS1GE|Oh I don't know there was some fucking that that German one which won it erm what was her name Nina Erm.
PS1GJ|Oh the one that sung in English and German and Spanish and French and Italian.
PS1GE|Yeah right at the end That was fucking brilliant.
PS1GJ|I didn't like the song but I must admit I thought it was quite clever.
PS1GE|It was brilliant That's the first time I've ever seen that done Or ever saw it done on the Eurovision.
PS1GJ|Yeah as I say I didn't like the song but I that was well clever.
PS1GE|Oh I du n no it got to number one Europe wide didn't it.
PS1GJ|Yeah I know I still didn't like it It got to number one here.
PS1GE|Yeah I thought it was pretty good.
PS1GJ|No it wasn't really my cup of tea But yeah it was well she what did she she sung in English and German Spanish and French.
PS1GE|She went right round She did the.
PS1GJ|Yeah.
PS1GE|the whole European countries.
PS1GJ|I think she I think she did about eight or nine European countries didn't she.
PS1GE|Yeah I think the only one she missed was Turkish Cos that the year they won that was the first year that what was it erm.
PS1GJ|Turkey hadn't finished last or something weren't it.
PS1GE|No who was it Finland got zero points.
PS1GJ|Oh that's right Finland yeah Poor old Finland they never seemed to get many points did they.
PS1GE|The the the the trouble is he got more recognition for that for getting no points at all than he did probably if he'd have bloody won that thing.
PS1GJ|The the trouble is though their their erm language just doesn't lend itself very well to pop music does it.
PS1GE|Well no they're the thing is with the European Song Contest each different country has its own tendency has its own leanings towards different types of material I mean no no erm.
PS1GJ|Yeah and you're you're own judge can't vote for yourself can you.
PS1GE|Yeah That's it I mean.
PS1GJ|That's why matey never got any points Cos nobody else liked Finland or something But didn't they get that get that.
PS1GE|I mean they y you.
PS1GJ|for two or three years though.
PS1GE|You you think about yeah.
PS1GJ|Two or three times Finland got.
PS1GE|Three times on the trot.
PS1GJ|Finland got no points.
PS1GE|And it was the same bloke each time.
PS1GJ|Was it.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|Was he the was he the only songwriter in the country or something then.
PS1GE|Something like that.
PS1GJ|That must have been the only man ever to get no points three times in a row They have had some crap win it though.
PSUN|Been a couple of good ones though.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|Well there has been like.
PSUN|Puppet on a Chain erm.
PS1GJ|But who was that Johnny Logan He was good.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|That was a nice song We've won it a couple of times haven't we.
PS1GE|Won it about six times.
PS1GJ|Have we.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|Didn't realize we'd won it that many.
PS1GE|Erm Bucks Fizz er.
PS1GJ|The only ones it was Petula Clark and Bucks Fizz the ones I know.
PS1GE|Eh.
PS1GJ|Petula Clark and Bucks Fizz are the ones I remember.
PSUN|Petula Clark Lulu Erm.
PS1GE|Really.
PSUN|Er.
PS1GE|What did she sing.
PS1GJ|Oh god.
PSUN|Er Mary Hopkins.
PS1GE|Is that what she sung.
PSUN|Erm no no Er Puppet on a String was er.
PS1GJ|No it was Petula Clark weren't it.
PSUN|No Mary Hopkins Erm.
PS1GJ|Who sung what did Petula Clark sing I can only remember those two.
PSUN|Er save all your kisses for Brotherhood of Man.
PS1GJ|Brotherhood of Man yeah that's true.
PSUN|Erm.
PS1GJ|That was a number one for years wasn't it.
PSUN|What you done now Trev.
PS1GJ|Nothing He's just trying to take the grease out of his fingers.
PS1GE|Erm erm erm erm erm erm erm Cliff Richards won it once.
PS1GJ|No he was a professional though He wou which wouldn't be allowed to enter.
PS1GE|Yes It was.
PS1GJ|Thought only were allowed to enter.
PS1GE|No there's loads of them Really as I said really.
PSUN|Say hey girl take a walk on the wild side.
PS1GJ|Yeah but I thought in the case of like Petula Clark and Lulu it was because they won it that got them into the scene sort of thing Certainly did for Bucks Fizz didn't it They.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|released an album on the strength of that song.
PSUN|Oh Fuck me he is in.
PSUN|Course.
PS1GE|Ooh.
PS1GJ|Bloody hell.
PS1GE|Hallo Damian How the devil are you.
PS1GP|Hallo mate Not too bad.
PSUN|How much is did you have to pay extra on this.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GE|I didn't get mine with Tech I didn't buy Technics.
PSUN|No.
PS1GE|They were eighty quid.
PSUN|Eighty quid are they.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GE|Cos they're virtually the third best going anyway.
PS1GJ|I I've heard quite good things.
PS1GE|Sony I could have got but they were seventy quid I didn't mind paying that sort of money but after spending so much on the Technics I couldn't afford another eighty quid.
PSUN|You going home.
PS1GJ|Yeah I I might go and treat myself to some today Cos they've got see I don't know whether I don't know whether it makes it Hemmings hey've got nought percent disc er interest and all that sort of stuff on every single thing.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|so I'm gon na see if they've got.
PS1GJ|Cos you can pay it off in ten monthly instalments you see so eight quid a month sort of thing No I might just go an see what sort of deal I can get.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|Cos I've been meaning to get myself some.
PS1GE|does it round about fifty quid But if you've got a decent Technics he said you want the best integrated.
PS1GJ|Yeah I might I mean I might I might go in the best ones I can get.
PS1GE|Say I've got a.
PS1GJ|I'm not I'm not overly fussed about this five C D carousel But it's good don't get me wrong it is well well but I really don't think you need it Cos I I mean I tend to change my mind about I'll be listening half way through a song and then get pissed get pissed off with the album and go and.
PS1GE|Yeah I know.
PS1GJ|change it And nine times out of alright say I've got another four choices but nine times out of ten I'll go and I will have put those four on in the mood that I'm sort of feeling then I'll fucking I want to listen to something completely different listen to The Jam I might want to go and listen to fucking bit of heavy rock or something or bit of pop or something you know.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|So I don't think I've ever I've had it for about eight months now and I don't think I've yet listened to all five in a row without changing it.
PS1GE|Mine's just the one C D.
PS1GJ|Yeah.
PS1GE|The only trouble is with that if you're changing it for different albums all the time it can wear out the gears and that That's the only trouble cos I'm always changing the damn thing.
PS1GJ|Well maybe it is a good thing yeah Cos all I have to do is Cos you.
PS1GJ|I I quite like the idea of these double ones you see don't they.
PS1GE|What.
PS1GJ|The the double tray ones.
PS1GE|No My auntie's got one.
PS1GJ|Don't think Tech I think Pioneer do them don't they.
PS1GE|Yeah and Sharp My auntie's got one which takes six discs in a little box like that It flips out with six discs in it.
PS1GJ|Yeah.
PS1GE|Which that is a good idea cos erm if you get bored with one song or one album you just click it and it goes to that But I have to keep changing it.
PS1GJ|carousel as well.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|but like I said nine times out of ten if I've got pissed off with an album I change all of them Just have a and I I don't listen to that lot then It's well flash though it really is It's like I said you you can lift up the cover and change four while one's playing It's only the one that's got like the bit over the top of it.
PSUN|What's this.
PS1GJ|A Technics carousel for the C D It's like five CD's in.
PSUN|Two of me uncles have got one stacking system without the put in a cassette or a cartridge type allowed six.
PS1GJ|Yeah.
PSUN|And it just ch shoots one in.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|I must admit I quite like these little mini systems they're well powerful.
PS1GE|I can't stand them.
PS1GJ|Really.
PS1GE|I don't like them at all.
PS1GJ|Oh I think they're quite good Cos I've got I've got.
PS1GE|There's no turntable though.
PS1GJ|Yeah I know well I haven't got a turntable with mine but.
PSUN|Do you remember Andy Tubby worked out there He had about three thousand pounds worth of C D in his car.
PS1GE|Yeah What one of those ten the one you put in the boot.
PSUN|Fucking amazing it was He'd say he'd give you.
PS1GE|Got ta fill it up with ten CD's and you just got.
PSUN|he give.
PS1GE|like a little pad in your car.
PSUN|Yeah he give give me a booklet and they get a little booklet with it And he'd say just take a look through he said just any one you want he said and I'll programme it that'll come straight through and he sort of s six speakers fucking ridiculous.
PS1GJ|What car did he have.
PSUN|Only an A M Citroen A top of the range Citroen A M.
PS1GJ|Cos I went to this kit car show and they had erm.
PSUN|Absolutely fucking beautiful motor though.
PS1GE|anyway not unless music coming out.
PS1GJ|No I was gon na say cos if he's got that that much it's probably more more than the car's worth They had this they had this A T Cobra.
PSUN|Yeah it's about no it's about fourteen fifteen grand.
PS1GJ|kit car right and they had it was a V twelve jag engine in it right Under the bonnet and it was fucking it was it was the best kit there It won it won the best kit car and this was at the national show so you imagine how good this thing was.
PSUN|Mm.
PS1GJ|And in the boot it had one of these things And all it's got just on the little armrest was like a little pack like that And it could programme everything on it just in that pack the radio and everything.
PSUN|Yeah.
PS1GJ|Fucking well And I saw come just over the top of the doors as well All nicely trimmed oh it was immaculate all chrome roll bars chrome bits at the front Fucking good car And he started it up V twelve jag engine I nearly fucking I was that excited with this car It was fucking great But I mean if I had enough money to do it like that's the kit I'd do.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GJ|Cos I've I've thought about a kit before but for the money I've got I couldn't do what I really wanted But if I had the money this is the car I'd do And I've.
PSUN|Well you've only got five pence so it don't allow you to fucking do.
PS1GJ|That's right Doesn't even spend on the Airfix paint And I I thought the only ones I've ever seen and they've got like things like three eight and Chevvy or maybe a V er And they're all nice engines but there is nothing that will ever get anywhere near the V twelve They're just pure fucking power and it's it's He'd sit there and vroom.
PS1GE|Bit like me really Just pure pure power.
PSUN|Been dreaming again boy.
PS1GJ|No this was fucking Actually you remind me of my fucking Triumph.
PS1GE|Sleek looks.
PS1GJ|at the moment Mark Firing on two cylinders.

PS1GJ|Five fifty.
PS1GE|Oh How much are you hoping to get Four fifty.
PS1GJ|I I I'd take a drop of a hundred yeah Thing is I I actually think it's worth fi about five hundred Cos they're not gon na get a brilliant car but they're certainly gon na get an alright one.
PS1GE|Yeah but your fucking biased aren't you.
PS1GJ|No I mean the thing is I all I wan na do is get rid of this fucking thing now It's been sitting outside my house for over a month And it's got an immaculate interior it's got an immaculate interior right It's got average mileage for the well below average mileage for the year It's got an M O T tax two new wheels on the back erm it's got an alright engine There's nothing wrong with it Er the bodywork's not brilliant but for a B reg car it's alright.
