PSUN|How.
PS1GF|I've got two boxes at home but I I mean its not brilliant but they do the job for me could be worth cos he driving out there as well wouldn't mind start get the old ferry ticket's tomorrow and piss off over there straight through France.
PSUN|Erm.
PS1GF|out to Holland.
PSUN|they offered me two for a boat right and they offered me one while I was there then I got home and they offered me one that late that evening job erm working like that was a Thursday and they wanted me to start on the week Monday I couldn't do it as it happens I had to give my weeks notice here get out there that quick so I fucking said I said to myself well they've first day they're gon na offer me a few more so yeah they offered me a couple more but way from so a bit unlucky I I wished I'd fucking taken it.
PS1GF|Well you could of done really I mean you could of fucking rang in rang in here on a Friday and.
PSUN|that's what I that's what I thought like cos I thought.
PS1GF|you know if they want the first day then there gon na have to do another lot so what's the point of sort of yourself out with fucking I wasn't really sure at the time that I wanted to go to so you know I I said no I needed this job but probably a bad I've been offered a couple of month one's as well one month and two month's but I mean the trouble is.
PSUN|The trouble is there are they.
PSUN|I was gon na say if you ain't permanently in employment you're a bit silly to take that especially if the er present climber and there's one there they offered me said it could be two weeks or it could be two years I don't know so I gambler or not I mean it depends how well you're you are as well.
PS1GF|Well most of them they saying are six contracts now they say say six month contract or eight month contract or a three month contract but I just had a couple that were like oh they could be a.
PSUN|Goal.
PS1GF|couple of months he said he it could be a couple of years it depends on how quick it get work gets done and how long they think they need you.
PSUN|What time is it.
PSUN|Does they put.
PSUN|Well maybe thirteenth.
PSUN|What time is it now.
PSUN|Quarter too.
