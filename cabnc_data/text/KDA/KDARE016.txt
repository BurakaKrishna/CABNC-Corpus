PS1GE|Half a mile and he was right up my arse and I was going at a far pace.
PS1GE|forty miles an hour in a forty zone and he just got right up my arse he was obviously somewhere in a hurry somewhere in a hurry you know I thought this off he is.
PS1GF|Nine times out of ten.
PS1GE|So I thought sod you I am not gon na move over and I am going at my own pace so I slowed down to about twenty miles an hour and it's a road about four miles long and er he just couldn't get past you know Oh thes er there was oncoming traffic just couldn't get past and I thought fuck it You're gon na stop behind me mate and I'm gon na do my own speed and that annoyed him more than anything else that was annoying him.
PS1GF|But why did you try and annoy him Alright he was not.
PS1GE|Because he was annoying me he was right up my arse.
PS1GF|yeah but it isn't a battle.
PS1GE|No it isn't a battle but it's not everybody retaliate.
PS1GF|Who who who gets the best who no but you shouldn't do that's why there's so many accidents with people retaliating.
PS1GE|So Course they do.
PS1GF|But don't don't get me wrong I mean I'm not saying I'm a fucking saint cos I've done and I'll probably do it again but.
PS1GE|But doesn't it annoy when somebody's.
PS1GF|Nine ti.
PS1GE|sitting right up your arse About two foot.
PS1GF|Yeah.
PS1GE|away from you.
PSUN|I slow right fucking down.
PS1GE|That's what I do.
PS1GF|Yeah.
PS1GE|Like I said twenty miles an hour that.
PSUN|That's a ain't it so.
PS1GE|That's annoying you but for how long without changing your speed I yo you don't.
PSUN|Yeah well they speed up.
PS1GE|you don't annoy me it annoys them they are the ones who are behind me.
PS1GF|Yeah but he's your doing it because it's annoying you though.
PS1GE|Oh no I I I find it highly amusing that they're getting fucking flustered behind me.
PS1GF|You just said you did it because them up your arse it irritates you.
PS1GE|Oh yeah that irritates me but I mean it's gon na it's gon na make them think again in n it Well they they don't have to sit right up your arse on your tail.
PS1GF|Course it would.
PS1GE|Yeah course it fucking would.
PS1GF|Like I said nine out of ten if I touch my brakes they'll drop back and if they don't then there ain't nothing I'm gon na do that's gon na make them drop back.
PS1GE|Well there's plenty of things you can do to make them drop back.
PS1GF|Yeah stupid things Like slam on your brakes or going slow If you're doing twenty in a forty and a copper comes along and pulls both of you it's gon na be you that gets fucking done not him There's no law saying he can't be be an inch up your arse as long as he don't hit you If you're doing if you're doing.
PS1GE|Why why why is he.
PS1GF|speed if you're doing it in a.
PS1GE|Why is.
PS1GF|if you're doing.
PS1GE|I'm doing under twenty miles an hour.
PS1GF|But have you ever heard of an ob obstructive speed If you're if you're.
PS1GE|No.
PS1GF|if you're obstructing the flow of traffic by doing twenty in a forty or fifteen in a thirty then they can by law do you.
PS1GF|But like I said if it if you if you do that then it's for them and for yourself but them being up your arse is irritating if you just fucking carry on as if nothing had happened but you're aware of the th them doing that then I think it's a fucking I've that's a psychological edge over them anyway it's just the personalities obviously but er.
PS1GE|How can it be a psychological though.
PS1GF|Cos they they they've obviously not made sense to realise that a dog might run out in front of you but you're doing sixty in a in a sixty zone and forty in a forty zone you're gon na have to slam on your anyway so it's them gon na be stupid it's not you being.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GF|stupid.
PS1GE|That's what I'm saying so there's no psychological over.
PS1GF|Cos if if you show them that we're not they're not getting at you.
PS1GE|Yeah that's right they ain't getting at me I'm getting at them I'm annoying them.
PS1GF|No they're can't you see by retaliating they are getting at you but if they hadn't of got to you you wouldn't of retaliated Like if I i i it's like if I.
PS1GE|Yeah but seen that yeah.
PS1GF|come up and insult you if it doesn't bother you you won't say a thing but if it does bother you'll come back and re say something back.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GF|Exactly So if you don't react at all.
PS1GE|I ca I can't get out of that car and say you're a fucking wanker I co the only way I could do the only way.
PS1GF|No.
PS1GE|yeah but.
PS1GF|well.
PS1GE|the only way that I can retaliate towards him to show him my cracking up there.
PS1GF|Don't you see by ha don't you see by not retaliating you're already showing us something it's just a personal opinion I have I've it's like I du n no if you have the se erm i if people are taking the mickey out of you ignore them.
PS1GE|Yeah that's right.
PS1GF|The same thing if somebody's annoying you like that ignore them like I said I don't mean I won't just let them sit there I'll touch my brakes a couple of times perhaps do the old bit with the mirror and like I said normally if they're if they're responsible drivers that have just happened they got a bit close then maybe they'll drop back as I've done.
PS1GE|No see nine times out of ten.
PS1GF|but.
PS1GE|they're fucking wankers.
PS1GF|But they are wank that.
PS1GE|But you know.
PS1GF|but if they are wankers nothing you do and including I mean I've done it in the past slowed right down and nine times out of ten it jus it just incenses them to drive even closer.
PS1GE|Yeah exactly and tha that's when you slam.
PS1GE|your anchors on and they're in the fucking wall.
PS1GF|But you've caused an accident.
PS1GE|Yeah as simple as that yeah I mean you've caused an accident.
PS1GF|So you soo.
PS1GE|but.
PS1GF|been driver.
PS1GE|No cos I haven't caused an accident because they are in the wrong anybody that gets anybody else up the arse no matter what you fucking did to them it's them wrong.
PS1GF|I know that I know that Mark But you would rather go through all the hassle and the dam of having the damage repaired to your car.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GF|and all this just for the sake over a bit of retaliation.
PS1GE|No I wouldn't go as far as that anyway but I'm saying they're in the wrong it's not you in the wrong they're in.
PS1GF|There is.
PS1GE|the.
PS1GF|there is no law saying that they can't drive that close to you you're advised against it.
PS1GE|Yeah exactly and then it's their their.
PS1GF|But then again yo you're you're advised against going over the speed limit that most people do I do I I tell yo like I said I'm not a saint cos like a couple of times when I was first driving especially in my fucking sprint cos it was a quick car I used to drive up people's arses and wait until I could overtake them and if they did slow down that used to incense me and I'd fucking I'd go right up there arse and then probably try and cut them up when I went overtook them and I s fucking learnt I got a I had a couple of close calls like people are slamming brakes on and stuff.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GF|and I didn't so much I just thought that it happened to me.
PS1GE|I think you should get.
PS1GF|a couple of times you know people were up my arse a couple of times and I retaliated a couple of times.
PS1GE|I think that it's that's very very rude Bad driving.
PS1GF|Oh yeah but can.
PS1GE|That somebody should be right up your arse so if you.
PS1GF|Oh it's not good.
PS1GE|that.
PS1GF|driving no I'm not.
PS1GE|that that.
PS1GF|saying that.
PS1GE|that's the way I look at it and.
PS1GF|But you can't you see that.
PS1GE|you you just show them something to back off as you say and my way of doing that is slow down and then nine times out of ten once they've got the hint well I'll sp speed it up again.
PS1GF|Like I said I've slowed down in the past for people like that and they haven't you know I don't think that.
PS1GE|Well if they don't then you slow right down again simple as that.
PS1GF|So that's affecting your journey.
PS1GE|No it isn't Not really my i idea of a journey is to get there in your own time you don't have to fucking speed everywhere.
PS1GF|I don't speed everywhere.
PS1GE|it's better than fucking better be being late than not being there at all.
PS1GF|Can't you that by retaliating yo.
PS1GE|No I can't.
PS1GF|you're interrupting your own journey as well.
PS1GE|No I can't sorry you're on the lost cause here.
PS1GF|Obviously I mean don't get me wrong.
PS1GE|If so if somebody is a bad enough driver to sit right up your arse three foot away from you then they deserve all they fucking get Simple as that.
PS1GF|But I I do agree with you slowing down probably does annoy them more than anything else you could do.
PS1GE|Yep.
PS1GF|but then again I'd rather just let them get on with it I'm not trying to convert you to the better way of doing things cos obviously I don't know a whether there's.
PS1GE|There no fucking better way of doing things is there.
PS1GF|But I do if you listen.
PS1GE|Just that it's different way of dealing with it.
PS1GF|If you listened Mark without interrupting I was just about to say I'm not trying to convert into a better way of doing things because obviously I don't know whether that's a different a better way of doing it what I said It's a just a.
PS1GE|It's a stu.
PS1GF|different way of doing things Alright yeah.
PS1GF|Yeah but you interrupted.
PS1GE|Yeah exactly cos there's not a better way of doing as far as I'm concerned.
PS1GF|No if you listened I wasn't gon na say that This is why you and Chris are so alike you won't let anybody fucking finish what they're gon na say You just jump in and get the wrong idea of the argument then I was just about to say to you that isn't the better way of doing things cos obviously neither of us knows that way it's just a different way and it was just a a matter of opinion so I mean.
PS1GF|at the end of the day it doesn't really make no odds as long as I'm not the bloke you're doing it to But then again I wouldn't be up tha far up your arse I mean like you sa you must have found yourself a couple of times getting close to somebody and without realising it and then they.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PS1GF|maybe touch the brakes and you back off yeah.
PS1GE|No no I I don't do that i I I I get to within about ten feet on the motorway or twenty feet on the motorway and that's about as close as I get.
PS1GF|That's still too close.
PS1GE|Oh yeah it's too close.
PS1GF|But don't.
PS1GE|Ah.
PS1GF|you don't you mean sometimes they touch they're brakes.
PS1GE|I mean as I as I get a.
PS1GF|and you realise ooh shit I'm a bit too close here back off.
PS1GE|No as as I'm going towards them I start touching my brakes anyway.
PS1GF|Yeah.
PS1GE|and I don't give any of this shit with lights If they're doing seventy miles an hour and I'm going faster and they're all the overtaking lanes are taken then I'll slow down to their speed I won't.
PS1GF|Yeah.
PS1GE|attempt to go past.
PS1GF|No I'm not I'm not saying that hav haven't you found yourself a couple of times not really so much on the motorway at all you just.
PS1GE|No not really.
PS1GF|you just find yourself up someone's arse without realising it.
PS1GE|Not unless I'm doing it deliberately.
PS1GF|No I know.
PS1GE|About fifteen twenty foot all the time.
PS1GF|That's too close.
PS1GE|No it's not they reckon you should leave a two second gap if yo if you're travelling at thirty forty miles an hour.
PS1GF|Here have you got your erm highway code here What are the braking distances you know.
PSUN|Three.
PSUN|seventy five a hundred.
PSUN|thirty five.
PS1GF|Seventy five in n it.
PS1GE|What thirty Say thirty.
PSUN|Thirty is seventy five.
PS1GE|Yeah four foot.
PSUN|So it's thirty by seventy five alright by is thirty five.
PS1GF|In which case fifteen or twenty foot is far too close.
PS1GE|Okay it's too close but how many how many cars travel any further than that apart.
PS1GF|I certainly do.
PS1GE|Oh right.
PS1GF|And tha that is one thing I'm I mean I'm not I'm not the best driver in the world but that is one thing I do try not to do cos as you say no matter what the circumstances are if I go up the back of somebody it is my fault.
PS1GE|Yeah exactly the back of too many fucking cars.
PS1GF|And you still s dri driving fifteen or twenty foot away.
PS1GE|Eh well that was just a fucking example.
PS1GF|Well I mean I yeah alright.
PS1GE|I d I don't know how.
PS1GF|Yeah.
PS1GE|far I drive away from them it could it could be twe.
PS1GF|But you would you think it's enough though.
PS1GE|it could be twenty foot it could be thirty foot it could be forty foot how how ca how far can you tell All I know is that I think it's a safe distance for me to drive behind that car at any given time.
PS1GF|Yeah.
PS1GE|And the only way you can do that is when you judge when you know tha your car.
PS1GF|Mm.
PSUN|What's that.
PS1GF|I said what really bugs me is when I'm driving and you come from behind somebody and then somebody overtakes you and.
PS1GE|Yep.
PSUN|Yeah they come right up.
PS1GE|Yeah but mind you.
PSUN|then cut past.
PSUN|All I know bibbing.
PSUN|I'd.
PSUN|your horn and cut him up a bit.
PS1GE|Yeah.
PSUN|Then when he stops get out the car and grab him by the neck then throw then I.
PS1GE|Fucking been talking.
PSUN|There you go.
PSUN|Alright excuse me going on the road.
