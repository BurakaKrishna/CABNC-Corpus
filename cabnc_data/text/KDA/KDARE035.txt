PSUN|Yeah you get you get blue ones which make your eyes bluer than.
PSUN|You can get ones that implant sort of colours.
PSUN|Yeah.
PSUN|actually when I think my eyes my eyes go dark green fucking they're almost like translucent green cos the are all fucking.
PSUN|walk into a shop and the girl the girl goes oh you look tired you think yeah yeah you know still fucking red you know that's what I.
PSUN|I don't get red I've never have done I its only sort of over the past sort of half year and I don't know why they never started started to go red.
PSUN|Did they.
PSUN|when they.
PSUN|You're supposed to change you contacts at least once a year.
PSUN|Yeah.
PSUN|er apparently after that you can start risking infection and they get hard and everything that's what I've noticed.
PSUN|My My.
PSUN|get mine in now.
PSUN|my aunty gets gets them back and she says they come back she she actually them and she she cuts them into the the shape of the.
PSUN|Iris.
PSUN|yeah and er she gets them back and er they've got to go through about twenty different processes before they're allowed out the shop or out the storage cos even then when they're in store they're they're some of them come back as cracked you get ones coming back from er customers sort of thing been and they come back and they've got pins in them they've got bloody great er bits on the outside of the outside.
PSUN|I've got the like I don't know what it is they've got like the little triangular something on one of the things its right on the edge of the like a little white mark on it that's.
PSUN|I I get it sometimes I I tell you what.
PSUN|I can't get it off I've soaked it in yeah.
PSUN|if if you go for a swim right and you with your contact lenses in I always wear my goggles over the top I mean obviously if you dive.
PSUN|yeah.
PSUN|and you open your eyes you miss the the contact right but always and er it so you take them straight out and you've got to clean them virtually straight.
PSUN|Well I swim with mine in and I haven't noticed anything.
PSUN|I don't know maybe its just me.
PSUN|Well you are a bit drunk.
PSUN|if you happen to get anything in your eye right the the thing I found was if you just close your eye and then open it again your contact lens would come up with your.
PSUN|No I've never had a problem like that.
PSUN|Yeah.
PSUN|You see I didn't realise I thought there was a soft or hard but there's actually soft and then there's.
PSUN|Yeah.
PSUN|allow and they reckon that soft ones are better suited too sports because because of the great action they're harder to to knock out whereas soft ones er have better other qualities I've got this little fucking book book that I picked up in the Boots in Farnborough the other day yes its quite interesting Hard ones have better greater durability and that er vision and that's it all the others is is fair.
PSUN|I don't know I say I found my ones brilliant they are.
PSUN|Yeah but but I'm just saying they reckon on this its like they had a little chart its either fair good or excellent and like all the others there was like vision and wear and stuff and the vision of that erm durability and vision capabilities were excellent on the on the erm.
PSUN|Hard ones.
PSUN|hard ones yes and just good on the and soft ones.
PSUN|but if you think about it there is the hard ones can have a lot better can't they I mean the only thing that'll actually harm them is that if you get poked in the eye or something and it shatters the lens cos they are actually.
PSUN|you can now get non shatter proof car lenses shatter.
PSUN|Shatter.
PSUN|shatter proof car lenses.
PSUN|non shatter proof.
PSUN|non shatter proof whatever non shatter I think they say.
