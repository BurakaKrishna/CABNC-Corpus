PS007|Don't let me stop people finishing their teas.
PS004|Anybody want a second cup of tea.
PS007|Er.
KB0PSUN|There's some more tea there I think.
KB0PSUN|I'm alright thankyou.
PS007|Can we begin.
PS004|Yes indeed Sorry Alan.
PS007|Erm I I think the only person missing i is Idris so I don't.
PS004|Yes I have an apology from Idris He rang me up last night to say that he is more or less confined to barracks now in the evening now that Phil is home.
PS007|Mm.
PS004|He can't leave her And he erm sends his apologies.
KB0PSUN|Apology from Mrs she's not too well tonight.
PS007|Right.
KB0PSUN|Erm Mrs erm Eileen one of our elderlies she's tied up with her husband who's in hospital.
PS007|Mm.
PS004|And Mrs is ill as you know Rhoda is ill And an apology from Merle from Salisbury Park.
PS007|Right Erm from the eighth chapter of the letter to the Romans For we are saved by hope But hope that is seen is not hope For what a man seeth why does he yet hope for But if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it Likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities For we know not to what we should pray for as we ought But the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered And he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god And we know that in all things god works for good for them that love him To them who are called according to his purpose Let us pray Father we pray that you will work for good with us Help us as we look to the future May we be guided by your spirit May ou your spirit guide our prayers and our thoughts and our hopes And father we pray that our hope may not be in vain but may lead us to sharing again in your kingdom And father we pray too for those who are not well and unable to come May they be sustained and kept according to their need And father we pray for ourselves And we pray too for those whom we represent That we may work together according to your will so that you may work for good in us Amen Er Sadly although I sent you a letter with suggestions for discussion I forgot to keep a copy of it for myself So but I hope if I stray too far from the path somebody will remind me I suggest that the first thing is erm comments on what recommendation you will be thinking of making to the church in regard to the visit of er Mr and Mrs Has anybody anything to say.
KB0PSUN|No and do you want this.
PS007|Oh maybe I should have it Thank you Erm.
KB0PSUN|Well I think er several points should be ventilated and er I I think the while you're doing the agenda this evening you could add something to each item in turn.
PS007|Mm Erm.
PS008|The only thing one would say though whilst agreeing with some of the the matters perhaps that may be aired have a bearing on the other matters in the agenda Perhaps number one the one that's in the first paragraph.
KB0PSUN|Yes.
PS008|I'll be in a position tonight perhaps after some discussion to make a recommendation one way or the other.
KB0PSUN|Yes Well well er yes well from what I've already learnt and I've got to be rather blunt in this matter I'm afraid that Carol's expectations.
PS008|John.
KB0PSUN|John rather's expectations regarding the amounts they're very ambitious indeed and I can't speak for Salisbury Park but if we're expected to pay a share of any alterations and so forth erm it would be very difficult for us to meet that commitment.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|Because we er if if his erm if his er desires were carried out we'd well we'd be talking about thousands of pounds Literally And the.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|I don't know whether I've spoken out of place because I'm not a member of Salisbury park but on the assumption that erm that we would have to share in the.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|expense you see of any changes.
PS007|Are there any other comments on his visit Er.
PS008|Well ju just to keep the ball rolling my first impressions were good and he seemed to be er there was some drive about them His sermon er well it was erm a reasonable sermon We're not going to get a good preacher The good preacher can get a much better church than this set up So we're er we're sort of well down the list as far as that's concerned Erm at first I was slightly put off by his choosing Cain and Abel as er.
KB0PSUN|certainly yeah.
PS008|the start the sermon but it it seemed to er develop reasonably Erm but I was er that was my own impression I rather admired what he's doing for Margaret because as far as I can see he's taking er as she's not able as far as I can see to er exist to live on her own and he seems to be taking over from elderly parents But erm I was er somewhat put off altogether by comments I heard from people who had been in much closer contact than I was because I I saw him very little of him really So I think other people have er a contribution to make which is well it would be important.
PS007|Anybody else with a comment.
PS004|Well personally I mean erm Margaret impressed me greatly but I think John was inclined to be full of his own importance for one thing He was exceptionally demanding and my fairly long conversation was that he almost lead me to believe that he had got the job because when he started making comments about putting his grandfather clocks in the church er thirty of them And building a.
PS007|Thirty grandfather clocks.
PS004|Yes.
PS007|Oh goodness.
PS002|What thirty.
PS004|Thirty yes.
PS002|Or or one.
PS004|He said he was a collector of antiques so I said I'd better keep out of the way.
PS004|Three O he said But the other thing that worried me he was inclined to be erm mind you I felt aggression in his sermon a little but he did incline to be very uptight Nervous And I feel that erm coming to a good pastorate I think he would with his history of having had trouble trouble I think possibly he he he would be ill.
PS007|Mm.
PS004|Because he was he was a bundle of nerves he couldn't keep still And er you know he was I mean for instance at Salisbury Park he probably didn't mean anything but on Saturday when I was saying goodbye to him he said now I hope there'll be somebody here at ten past ten to open this church tomorrow I like to be here half an hour before the service So I said well I said I usually try to get here quarter past ten or soon after but it all depends on traffic because I live the other end of the town Er however I got there at quarter past ten and he followed me in And then no sooner got in he said by the way two glasses of water for me I'm a two glass water man.
PS004|So I said it's quite alright Mr we're not very well off in Salisbury Park but we do possess a carafe and that holds three.
PS004|And then he said here's the hymns put those hymns up now I said that's not my job it's the organist But I thought oh dear me That was my feeling and I feel that er.
PS008|Not conducive to a.
PS004|Not not for Salisbury Park Not for me.
KB0PSUN|No I'll I can endorse that by saying that we shouldn't as I noticed a certain offhandedness with him that I didn't like at all.
PS007|Mhm.
KB0PSUN|I I I don't know why he talks that of attitude but there we are.
PS005|Mr chairman as a colleague I felt he was alright.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|We had a quite good fellowship together I heard him here and I think our people was well impressed in some respect We endorse what you said There was a terrible nervousness which you don't expect from a man of that age and of that standing in the ministry And then it was further endorsed because I went to hear him at Johnstown and I thought to myself well I felt sorry that he was erm what's the word I want Well he was erm oh I can't think of the word I want now but er he he was glued to his notes.
PS007|Mhm.
PS005|You know There was no freedom No freedom Erm not really and it was a a different type of sermon.
PS008|Yes.
PS005|Er I felt another thing which I I wasn't too happy about but then again one can soon change these things For instance the the hymns that he all had I presume at Salisbury Park er certainly with us and at Johnstown and at the Rio where there's no alternative was all from the congregation.
PS008|Yes yes.
PS005|Now he knew beforehand because we told him when he came first came here that we also use Mission Praise and you do.
PS008|And we do.
PS005|I I would have thought personally I would have thought he would at least have chosen one from Mission Praise for the benefit of the be for the people who who like.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|that sort of thing you see And I think.
PS007|Well you do get more modern hymns in that don't you.
PS005|Beg your pardon.
PS007|You get more modern hymns in that.
PS005|More modern hymns and I should have thought you know er I would have liked him being a little more up to date.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|in that respect Personally I liked him as a man and I thought er Mrs was a delightful lady She was a very sweet person.
PS008|Oh she was delightful Yes yeah.
PS005|Erm but I think I can agree with what Norah has said er er er regarding the possibility of aggressiveness there.
PS004|Mm.
PS005|If I may just add one other thought Whoever the minister that comes to us I think that they should accept the manse without question That's what we like to do brethren.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|All down through the years Haven't we.
PS007|Yes.
PS005|Some of them being too large But we've had to bear with it Too cold but we've had to bear with it And why there should be such a change these days in that line I I I can't quite agree with it Er for two persons two people that manse was adequate I would say I was delightfully surprised with it myself A reasonable.
PS004|Well I know you were all seemed to be s you were all amazed when you went in I could tell by the expression on your faces when only I felt.
PS005|Yes I was amazed.
PS004|it was only fair to take them in and then they know.
PS007|I think ye.
PS004|what we were talking about Well.
PS007|Yes you did right.
PS004|But each one said ooh it's not as small as we thought it was you see.
PS007|Mm.
PS004|But erm it's just having that one room with a kitchen I think for if someone calls probably you see.
KB0PSUN|Mm Nice little room though.
PS008|It could be.
KB0PSUN|True Table and a couple of chairs and portable television if you want it.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
KB0PSUN|Quite nice And adequate.
KB0PSUN|But er you know reasonable demands are all well and good Perhaps if he if he if he could ask a thing like this then I'm sure Salisbury Park would oblige But you know if he's saying well we do we would like the house redecorated all well and good.
KB0PSUN|Oh well yes those are those are normal things.
KB0PSUN|No but as erm Mrs has mentioned to me when it comes to er converting an existing garage into a den or a study and then asking for another garage to be built Well you know it's not good enough is it.
PS008|I would think that's out because it would destroy the value of the house er that that has got to be sold some time.
PS004|House of course and it wouldn't suit another person would it.
PS007|Yeah.
PS008|But er I wouldn't agree that that er manse i that house is suitable for a manse.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
PS008|It wants at least one more room downstairs It would be very unfair to er Margaret that every time somebody called she's got she's banished to the kitchen And er he he could use the er h his vestry or another room at the the church but somebody calling in the evening he's not going to take them over to a a cold room for an interview.
PS002|But but if he knew if he knew Ken that they were coming You know.
PS008|Ah but then he wouldn't necessarily.
PS002|Mm But most people duly come surely make an appointment But I I think.
KB0PSUN|No some do some don't.
PS002|I think in some way here with this particular situation as okay we we go into the question of the house now the house shouldn't be the issue here.
PS008|No.
KB0PSUN|Oh no not not.
PS002|Wi with this situation the.
KB0PSUN|The question has been raised that's right.
PS002|Erm obviously the er and as Alan's asked us few weeks ago permission to explore maybe looking for the finances if and when it became the situation.
PS008|That's right.
PS002|But if er John came last week and to all of us we were of a like mind that yes he fitted the calling here everything else I I see then that the manse would be the issue but basically now we're talking in many ways other issues are affecting the call here than the manse so therefore the manse goes down the the pecking order.
PS007|Erm.
PS002|But basically the matter we consider is John the suitable man for the ministry.
PS007|Yes I I think I think that is the proper order to do things.
PS008|Yes.
PS007|I think first of all we want to know er as far as it's possible which of course is always er within the limitations of our abilities whether we think he's a man that we can recommend to the church that they should call him Now the people I've heard speaking so far don't seem to think so Is there anybody who disagrees with that assessment Just to complete the picture.
KB0PSUN|Well we had him for the weekend and er looking back on the weekend we were reasonably impressed with the man and his wife And er from his conversation he appeared to be a homely sort of a chap and er he was outspoken but he would call a spade a spade Er in church his diction was clear for all to hear He spoke well to the children and er his sermon message did have a a reasonable amount of substance in it But under the circumstances of being there on trial I did feel that he was very nervous Er the Saturday evening we were in the lounge and chatting away for two or three hours and he he could not keep still He was.
PS004|Mm that's right yeah.
KB0PSUN|moving to the left and to the right and sliding down.
PS004|Down and moving his seat.
KB0PSUN|He he.
KB0PSUN|He's uncomfortable.
KB0PSUN|He was uncomfortable And when he was in the pulpit I felt that he was there was tension there was tension there.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|Er whether he did say in a conversation that he he knows when this nervousness er er and depression is coming on and he takes medication and it's alright But er that's to be seen.
PS004|I might add that Idris rang me up last night I was on the telephone for about three quarters of an hour with him.
PS007|That's typical Idris.
PS004|But he did ring up He he said you're one person I can talk to you listen to me and I can talk to you and er he didn't want to worry you at that time but for him he didn't think he was suitable Even Idris who er they're desperate for but he Idris didn't think you know he could cope with the four churches.
KB0PSUN|Well Idris rang me up last night which is not unusual because he often rings you know.
PS004|Yeah.
PS005|once a week to me and I ring him occasionally and er his first remark which was quite erm natural he said well you know Ernest he said I've heard many ministers.
PS004|Yes.
PS005|Like we all have haven't we And we're we're all guilty of being critics.
PS004|Mm Mm.
PS005|But erm Idris said in effect which is an expression which we've all used at some time or another he did nothing for me.
PS004|That's right yes.
PS005|In inverted commas He did nothing for me.
PS004|Mm Mm Mm.
PS005|You see And er I knew what Idris was referring to you see.
PS008|I thought.
PS005|Somehow or another erm Idris and I have clicked somehow or another and erm I understand him and he understands me.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|And that's how we've er been able to get on so well together.
PS004|Yes same here Same here.
PS005|you know.
PS004|Yeah.
PS005|Er but I would add this to you know please do not depend in any way upon Beria.
PS004|No cos he.
PS005|Because it's it's folding up it's dying quickly.
PS004|Yes.
PS007|I'm I'm afraid that is so.
PS005|That is so.
PS007|I I don't I honestly don't know what we're going to do about Beria.
PS005|No I don't but So it's more or less a threesome if anything at all.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|Really.
PS009|I thought his nervousness was because of the ordeal of you know er being before us as a.
PS004|But it shouldn't be after all that time.
PS009|you know.
PS008|This was one of the one of the things I asked him wasn't it When we were when we were.
PS009|Yes.
PS008|talking afterwards about the team ministry and working together and the problems and his experiences.
PS005|You're not nervous are you Peter.
PS009|No but u under the circumstances a man that a man who.
PS005|take the biscuits.
PS009|yeah who has er had nerv you know.
PS008|Yeah.
PS009|a nervous problem.
PS008|Mm.
PS009|perhaps it was because of the situation.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
PS009|You know and perhaps if he came he would overcome it.
PS008|Yes I agree but I think that anybody who speaks in public you have nervousness beforehand and the moment you go to talk to the people you know what you're going to say you have a few notes in front of you and you talk to the people if that is your job.
KB0PSUN|Absolutely.
PS008|It's what you do.
KB0PSUN|Yes.
PS008|No matter how much your knees tremble underneath underneath the table But you talk to people with the fervour of what you want to tell them.
KB0PSUN|That's true.
PS007|Er I I think I would agree with you there that I mean it's natural to be nervous.
PS008|Absolutely yes.
PS007|in a situation like that.
PS008|Yes.
PS007|but usually once one gets sort of started it it gets better.
PS005|And he he possibly had done it at least a half a dozen times.
PS008|Oh must have done.
PS008|Yes.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|Even even if he wasn't accepted on a first occasion he's probably had another two or three attempts elsewhere.
PS008|Yeah.
PS005|So he's done it before.
PS008|And and lots of churches that he was telling us that he'd been in contact with And he must have gone to those churches for the first time And I don't suppose that you know a new ministry is so very different from meeting people in a new church.
PS005|That's right People are the same everywhere.
PS008|Well yes And they are all there willing you to do well.
PS005|Yes yes.
PS008|Whatever you know audience you're speaking in front of I mean of course you're going to be judged adversely perhaps but i in a church you are being listened to by people who are of like mind and therefore willing you to have something of value and interest to say to them.
PS007|Er yes that that is important because qu I mean when you feel that people are sympathetic.
PS008|Mm.
PS007|then it's easier to speak.
PS008|Mm.
KB0PSUN|Oh yes.
PS008|And we wouldn't have invited him if we weren't sympathetic would we.
PS007|Hardly.
PS008|You know.
PS009|Oh well if he's a nervous person he wouldn't think like that would he.
PS008|Well exactly.
PS008|No I feel that this ties in with his nervous breakdown.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
PS008|We had a somewhat similar experience at a previous church I was at where we were looking for a minister and the the man er who was who came to us was again very nervous and excitable and so on Fortunately we had a doctor in our congregation who er was s had some knowledge of psychiatry and he had a fairly long session with him just the two of them And he strongly recommended us not to accept this man And this man went to another church not so very far away so we knew what happened and certainly we were very glad we accepted our doctor's opinion.
PS008|Mm.
PS007|Mm Well it looks as though er there's a fairly clear majority against er making a call as far as I read it I don't do you want a show er do you want to vote.
KB0PSUN|Oh does anybody know the of the y the younger people the younger members of the churches Did he appeal to the younger members Or.
KB0PSUN|No Not not as far.
KB0PSUN|oh well.
PS007|Er.
KB0PSUN|if we send a recommendation to.
PS002|a recommendation to the church you see so I.
KB0PSUN|Erm.
PS002|You must know the feeling of this meeting first mustn't you.
PS007|Yes.
PS002|But one one would say no I mean I don't disagree with what you said about er the children's address well I do personally.
PS004|Yes.
PS002|Erm he the same children's address here as he did in Salisbury Park.
PS004|Did he Mm.
PS002|I would think so about the elephants.
PS005|That's right.
PS004|Yeah.
PS002|Right And in in er.
PS004|Our children weren't.
PS002|the children didn't even know he was talking to them.
PS004|Mm He stayed up on the pulpit or whatever didn't he.
PS002|Erm you see if this the pulpit he didn't come s.
KB0PSUN|Yeah.
PS002|And what I was gon na say Alan was perhaps like Mr you know we had one of the ones sitting here that did go up to two services I also went to Johnstown yesterday So I heard him in Salisbury Park last week and in Johnstown yesterday I felt a a degree of obligation because of my commitment with Johnstown now.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|so I went to Johnstown yesterday afternoon Well I I've got ta be honest in what I'm saying I sat through two services yesterday the morning service did a lot for me But the afternoon service did nothing.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
PS002|The morning service in fact I would I've got ta say it Norah.
PS004|Mm.
PS002|The minister we had taking the service yesterday morning I think felt as much on trial in Salisbury Park.
PS004|I'm sure he did Yes he did.
KB0PSUN|Yes yes.
PS002|because he was a student with us.
PS004|It was Mm Yeah.
PS007|Mhm.
PS002|And had come back yesterday.
PS004|He was nervous wasn't he.
KB0PSUN|He was Yeah.
PS002|after his first appointment was as much on trial as Kenneth.
PS004|Yeah.
PS002|And but yesterday.
PS004|Hasn't he improved.
PS002|relaxed.
KB0PSUN|Definitely improved.
PS002|unwound himself and you could tell his two years what it had done for him.
KB0PSUN|Hadn't it just.
PS002|Marvellous But.
KB0PSUN|yes incredible.
PS002|a number of people said to me how much they enjoyed yesterday's service.
PS004|Mm.
KB0PSUN|Yeah.
PS002|He also took a communion service again which was.
KB0PSUN|yeah.
PS002|But I came home and feeling I could relate all I'd.
KB0PSUN|Yeah.
PS002|But I sat in yesterday afternoon and I felt sorry for the man's daughter who'd been given a hymn the service.
PS002|Who was put on a spot Erm and as you said he he couldn't leave his notes Cos I'll have to confess to you I saw him diligently once looking below the pulpit.
PS002|at his at his notes.
KB0PSUN|Yeah.
PS002|of what he was gon na do next.
KB0PSUN|Yeah.
PS002|Erm there was the whole time a sense of anxiety about him Alright he knew he had to go to afterwards half past three but he couldn't unwind one bit there And there are occasions I think we all agree alright we have to have notes but you must unwind a little bit to get near to the people And I would not feel that Kenneth would ge could get near to any one of us.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|But I hate to say it because obviously he wants to find to go somewhere But I don't think this is the place And heart to heart having sat through two I went home it was heavy.
PS007|Mm.
PS009|Well a lot of our people said they liked him didn't they.
PS005|Yes oh yes Yes Yes erm you see we're in a different different situation than what you are at Salisbury Park We haven't had to make a demand upon our congregation to make such a decision for twenty two or twenty five years you see.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|Whereas you've had to do that at Salisbury Park you see May I just say I went to erm Johnstown yesterday because I had half promised our friends here that I would go to support them.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|It wasn't actually my Sunday I I'd forego'd that Sunday afternoon for agreeing to come there That's why I went But I I also wanted an endorsement.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
PS005|of what I heard the previous week.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|And I think naturally we would all like that.
PS007|Erm.
KB0PSUN|Well going back to the very first meeting that we had.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|I did come away that er really wasn't struck But I didn't like at all the er excuses he made for his wife.
KB0PSUN|er that we weren't employing her.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|Well right-oh we er I don't think we ever do expect that much But all the same at the same time we do expect them to mix.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|If they're going to mix with the church then they'll be only too happy to take some part in it.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|But then in the sermons when he came here to preach er I didn't see any sign of nervousness myself Couldn't see any sign of nervousness myself but er I'm very happy with his sermons quite good But er at the same time the further I go on the more apprehensive I get about it Whether coming here or not and I don't really think that you know coming back to it I don't think he would fit in.
PS007|Mm Er well.
KB0PSUN|We are rather an old congregation there's no doubt about it apart from the here.
KB0PSUN|But er you can I mean we've got of course I'm not too young myself but er we are set in our ways.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|And that takes up with the Can't alter that.
PS008|What bothered me most was the fact that he.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
PS008|What bothered me mo well wha one of the things that bothers me is the fact that he said that he wouldn't like to do hospital chaplaincy because he wouldn't like to go visiting because he's got no small talk And I'm just wondering what the the knock on effect of that is in the visiting of the the members who can't get into church and who can't receive communion in church and who may like to receive it in their home or in the home where they live Because you don't just suddenly go in give communion to someone and walk away again do you.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
PS008|You you ha you establish a rapport of listening for a little while to whatever it is that they've got to say and their troubles and their anxieties and I wasn't happy that.
PS007|Mm.
PS008|there would be that sympathy I'm certain that the sympathy is there with his wife.
PS004|Yes.
KB0PSUN|Yes.
PS008|Absolutely But I don't how much that compassion and love for fellow people goes beyond his wife to the congregation.
PS004|Mm.
PS008|I don't know I don't know.
PS007|Mm.
PS008|And if if he says to us in meeting that he's got no small talk and no erm ability for visiting in a hospital situation where you can ask people how they are and then can move to the next person you've got to see I'm not sure how he would be visiting someone in their home.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|It's also a question isn't it of whether you appoint a man because he's a good preacher or secondly because he's a good pastor That's really the question isn't it.
PS007|Mm.
PS004|You never get the two.
PS005|You can't get the two.
PS008|You're very lucky if you do aren't you.
PS005|I would say the second is the more important.
PS004|The more important being a good pastor.
PS008|Yeah but you must that that that your congregation that all the people in the pastorate must know that they can go to you and that you will listen.
KB0PSUN|Yes that's.
PS008|And that you they they that they will have for the time that they are in your company your whole attention And your whole mind concentrated on what happens to be concerning them Whatever else you've left behind at home.
PS007|Mm.
PS008|But for that moment you are there for them I in their service You know.
PS007|Mm.
PS005|In other words the skills of a counsellor.
PS004|Yes Yes.
PS008|Definitely Definitely.
PS007|Er well as far as I can see erm with with a few minor reservations the the elders would prefer not to recommend to the church that a call be issued Ha have I got it right.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
KB0PSUN|Yes I think you are right I think.
PS009|Well you've got to have a unanimous decision haven't you.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
PS009|And I mean yo you know there's three to one isn't it.
PS007|Erm oh you mean in favour.
PS009|In favour yeah.
PS007|of a call.
PS009|Yeah.
PS007|Yes Well certainly I mean one would want to have a substantial majority in favour of a call to issue it Now whether in fact the church meeting would come to a different conclusion from us I've no means of knowing but probably not because most of you know something about the church that you're working with.
KB0PSUN|Well impressed with.
PS009|That's what I'm saying Our our people seemed.
KB0PSUN|They all liked him.
KB0PSUN|our congregation yesterday and erm the feeling I got was that erm we couldn't support a minister ourselves and we're and well at least the congregation think that they're there entirely to help Salisbury Park Erm and I think I go with them o on these lines And we're hoping to get something out of that sale.
KB0PSUN|Mm.
KB0PSUN|and what we're trying to do is plough whatever we get back into the group.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|so that erm more or less Salisbury Park are the people who really Th they said that whatever the decision decision they make they would fall in with them.
PS007|Mm.
KB0PSUN|So er it looks as if the decision's against so I'm almost sure that the decision at Johnstown will be against.
PS007|Well.
