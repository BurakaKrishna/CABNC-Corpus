PS003|Oh you won't need sixteen megabytes even if you decide to improve the let's unpack that thing and then we'll see how much space we're talking about how much of that's padding and how of that is real thing I was taught that when I worked in the grocery warehouse If you open a box with a penknife always do that.
PS007|So that you have to.
PS003|So get it to go all the way.
PS007|Cut the end that's for.
PS003|Do the contents the world of good.
PS007|Mm.
PS003|Oh What's happened to this.
PS007|Yeah.
PS003|Yep get it out.
PS007|Whatever.
PS003|Right we're on to this roll now Oh Right.
PS003|Right Can you pull that off That one Right Before I realised I've got mine Okay.
PS007|It is slightly bigger than the other one isn't it.
PS003|Quite a lot bigger actually Mm.
PS007|Oh dear Yes it's got more back to it Oh the screen mm about the same size.
PS003|It's a little bit bigger I think you'll find if you put the tape measure on it you'll find it's a little bit bigger Right Right.
PS007|Presumably this is the power supply for it.
PS003|Yeah Woops The main colour monitor operating instructions in here How many spare points you got.
PS007|Erm one at the moment but I can pull out the radio without any problem.
PS003|Oh fine It's a.
PS007|No one of these spools.
PS003|Full wear.
PS007|If I can crawl under here I.
PS003|Yes I just wan na have a look at yes you can crawl under there to your hearts content You can unplug that for the moment I'm not really worried about it.
PS007|No I just thinking it's easier if I take it down this way.
PS003|Oh alright.
PS007|Then I pull it.
PS003|Now Ultimately er they might change the lead on the end of that monitor What's the matter.
PS007|I was wondering where the socket is Oh I see where it's gone.
PS003|Right.
PS007|I should have Oh there's plenty of wire.
PS003|Oh yes.
PS007|Right.
PS003|Now if I'd have been sensible.
PS007|Yes.
PS003|which I really am I'd have brought over my.
PS007|Oh.
PS003|what's his name My monitor.
PS007|Why.
PS003|Well if I'd swapped monitors with you can pro and I don't suppose you'll wan na get rid of your Amstrad today.
PS007|No.
PS003|and you'll probably want to keep it for a little while.
PS007|Yes.
PS003|Oh hang on moving leads and things don't stand up Not just yet anyway.
PS007|Right.
PS003|Erm I could of taken the black and white one.
PS007|Mm.
PS003|and then I could have shown mine to this lady cos I mean the only difference is is the black and white isn't it.
PS007|Er yes.
PS003|Er I'll have another lead for you in just a sec I'm afraid Hang on a mo just screw this in Right straight under there there is actually a power outpoint on this so if we can get the right kind of plug.
PS007|Yes.
PS003|we could actually drive the monitor off the box and you'd only need one socket.
PS007|Well it doesn't really matter because I got and unused socket here.
PS003|Yeah but I mean if you i in some ways it's easier cos then when you turn it off you turn everything off You see what I mean.
PS007|Yes.
PS003|Er erm there's a white plug have a seen a mucky grey a white plug I'll lower it down here.
PS007|I've got yes.

PS007|have to look it up Er I should know it but.
PS003|No handbook but I suppose we can buy some dos five handbooks.
PS007|Well I was thinking that.
PS003|It would be worth copying all that off.
PS007|Yes.

PS007|No.
PS003|Cos I haven't sorted them out yet.
PS007|Mm.
PS003|Er I'm gon na sit down quietly and do it one day erm it's and make a sub-directory That's for storing Can you scroll that down a bit Oh Hang on.
PS007|Further.
PS003|No just as bit more yeah Leave your sub- directory as utils Yeah and I want to make the sub-directories so that can Make a sub- directory as Make as sub-directory as wp papers It's gon na take as long as I thought cos I have to format it and install it Make a sub-directory as Wordperfect fifty one.
PS007|Actually that is that a sub-directory or a main one.
PS003|It's a sub-directory of the root directory it's alright.
PS007|I see.
PS003|And that's it And you've got a sub-directory which says docs.
PS007|Yes what.
PS003|Have you ever used that.
PS007|I don't think I have used it.
PS003|Well you can always make no I don't need to make the rest because erm oh yes graphics Make a sub- directory as graphics.

PS003|Oh don't really need this Never mind Is this the order you put them up in.
PS007|Yes.
PS003|Oh so you'd like those in order put back in there.
PS007|The only thing is I did wonder whether the two.
PS003|What.
PS007|there's two files at the end which I thought maybe ought to be at the beginning Where are they.
PS003|In there.
PS007|Er.
PS003|They're all in one big directory dos.
PS007|These two.
PS003|doesn't care.
PS007|You see those two are right at the end and those I don't know whether those ought to be together before x.
PS003|Well it they're.
PS007|So.
PS003|all in one directory.
PS007|It doesn't matter.
PS003|It doesn't care.
PS007|I see.
PS003|It's called Bible isn't it.
PS007|Yes.
PS003|Copy mm perhaps it doesn't like Oh that's the only thing You're gon na get used to that The se there's no second star In that er Bible Oh That's cos I made a mistake if I did I forget to do a word there No Star.
PS007|Oh So that's drive B is it.
PS003|Yeah Star.
PS007|I haven't bothered to make a label.
PS003|No I don't blame you.
PS003|Take them long enough wouldn't it.
PS003|Alright.
PS007|Mm.
PS003|Right I will get used this drive sooner or later Boring this in n it.
PS007|Yes Still it has go got to be done Well you could leave those couldn't you.
PS003|No it's alright I like to check that it all works you know Get a few things on it and check that it works It won't take long.
PS007|Right you are.
PS003|How many discs did you say this was.
PS007|Twenty one of them.
PS003|Mm.
PS007|Er this one yes I think we'll put that.
PS003|Yeah no I'm putting them that way on top of each other That's right Hopefully another coffee.
PS007|I've just put the kettle on.
PS003|Oh.
PS007|I thought you might be ready for one.
PS003|Actually they spend more time changing discs probably than the.
PS007|Than the actual copying yes Well you can't help it when you copy.
PS003|Well look at the speed it takes a disc onto the hard disc Watch.
PS007|Now is that a file.
PS003|That's a whole file.
PS007|Oh yes it takes long spends longer reading than it is.
PS003|Oh yeah Much longer.
PS007|Yeah.
PS003|Well it's longer it's about ten times as long.
PS007|Ha Oh because that's the er.
PS003|That's a slow floppy in n it.
PS007|Mm.
PS003|Floppies are that is terrible I'm up to book fourteen.
PS007|You what.
PS003|I'm up to book fifteen.
PS007|Oh.
PS003|Oh I'm more than half way through Only nine left.
PS007|Good Suppose I could of put this out there.
PS003|What are doing It should be going down Fortunately this'll be the biggest job of all I suppose actually loading Wordperfect will be the slowest job of all Always takes a bit longer doesn't it.
PS007|Mm It's er there's not so many discs to load though.
PS003|No.
PS007|There's not so many discs.
PS003|No but er I can't just do this with it.
PS007|No Where are you going.
PS003|Just wan na look at those I mean Autoroute's only about three files Only got.
PS007|Yeah.
PS003|three discs so that won't take very long D-base is what Five at the moment You know it says book forty do you have to know which books you want to go into.
PS007|Yes erm er it's on a file somewhere.
PS003|Oh No is it It's not the easiest thing to.
PS007|No that's one of the.
PS007|reasons why I've made little use of it Erm.
PS003|Never mind.
PS007|I could probably re-name them.
PS003|To make it easier to remember except it maybe it refers to it maybe it uses book something to refer to them You might have to write the whole programme again to do that.
PS007|Oh well maybe I'd better not try then There's some coffee here.
PS003|Sorry I've nearly finished this I'd like to get it done before I.
