PS007|Oh dear my batteries are going flat Oh no it's alright Erm.
PS002|So what are you trying it out for somebody are you.
PS007|No er.
PS002|We to were you recording.
PS007|I've been doing doing so.
PS002|You have Now you won't about the Wrexham.
PS007|Er yes.
PS002|Did you have did you read those words.
PS007|Er yes I just glanced through it.
PS002|Oh.
PS007|Well actually there's no decision yet from the church meeting.
PS002|Yeah.
PS007|so we've still got to.
PS007|Yes but they could.
PS002|And they could.
PS007|sell it.
PS002|I mean my favourite but.
PS002|Mm.
PS002|And it was a major problem of finance it seems to me when you've two possible avenues left to take.
PS002|When you I think it's yes.
PS002|One is getting a loan from the church.
PS002|Mm.
PS002|and repaying it at five percent interest or whatever is a rate of.
PS007|Yes.
PS002|fare And there's no guarantee they'll they'll lend it.
PS007|If they ask for money.
PS002|The other is to apply to come back that I the interest that I I was told that o over a year ago but I haven't found any yet.
PS007|I see.
PS002|I've got a lot of information about tru charitable trusts but all I can't see that any one of them which is you know would have that as one of the things.
PS007|I see.
PS002|Now I haven't finished but I mean I it really is at the top of my mind yo you know it hasn't I haven't given it top priority.
PS002|Well you've got a lot of other things to think about I'd say.
PS002|Well all the other things have been more urgent so therefore I haven't really pursued it to its limits.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|So you know if if you find there's a position for when they absolutely need help you know phone me again or write to me again and tell me you've you've you've set everything.
PS007|Well keep in touch.
PS002|But well I mean I it's a so far I really don't push.
PS007|I see.
PS002|I've got the names of lots of.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|I'll try to get started But you know if you need some I can't any of them a as being willing to.
PS007|Mm mm.
PS002|In the pipeline But there may something at the there might.
PS002|Oh there mi there might be I think might be because it's a the four churches toge together.
PS002|That's right.
PS002|If it need it to share the cost of the new one but once it goes on the.
PS002|Sa.
PS002|four churches.
PS007|Yes.
PS002|and not on the one and er also therefore you'll have the if you like.
PS007|Yeah.
PS002|or I wish some other churches would come and.
PS007|Well we'll be stuck into finding a finance man er to watch the cost over the.
PS002|You need.
PS007|Yeah I mean.
PS002|You've got ta look at the same as.
PS007|Have you got.
PS002|Erm in the personals.
PS007|to me.
PS002|and the personal situation now is that economic climate get a house how many are talking here.
PS007|sometimes from a.
PS002|Like you'd better can I get rid of these.
PS007|Please.
PS002|Would you be able stay with the one you've got.
PS002|Well the one we've got above our in fact there's one next door to us going for sale at the moment and they're asking advertised prices else you'll be getting about fifty thousand on top that's ours It was a short she wants fifty thousand pound for And because that one even if we didn't rule out it says fifteen forty.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|And it seems for the churches we'd then be looking up to point forty perc fourteen percent for fifty thousand pounds.
PS007|A actually John was suggesting that we might talk nicely to John's dad about the money they've got invested in the sale of their pro their ground I don't know how far we'd get but er it's worth looking at.
PS002|The only thing is though I mean you see but I think the church itself and I would say the church as the group now.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|would be looking at that as a more meaningful contribution to.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|Well what else can you talk So to be able to the sweepstake in the past another church and they could be they could be on the interest you know the amount towards running costs such as this Well to me running costs wouldn't be and the cost of towards borrowing a house is the same way you know.
PS002|Well exactly The point is that looks very nice.
PS007|Yeah.
PS002|You know but I mean if the church can not find contributions it really can't Well you see like like.
PS007|Exactly Yes well erm we're still going to have to talk about it with the elders you see.
PS002|Sorry what did you say.
PS007|We're still going to have to talk about with the e with the.
PS002|With the.
PS007|joint elders group.
PS002|Yes yes yes yes.
PS007|Erm.
PS002|Quite right.
PS007|which meets on Monday Er so I might be in touch with you after that.
PS002|Oh right But I mean even now you can you can read that thing out to me.
PS007|Yes.
PS002|I mean that that was you er goals you know No no messing I mean I did that ages ago and I i it just arrived I think I was already in.
PS007|Did you have a good holiday by the way.
PS002|Lovely holiday thank you But I wa but I was there for a fortnight and when I came back I you know it's preparing for Synod just takes all the time we have somehow and I.
PS007|Oh yes.
PS002|I I was only off the plane just last week I'd better have a look at this.
PS007|Yeah.
PS002|dear dear dear.
PS007|Just a mi matter of interest where do you come from because on this dictionary thing I'm supposed to put down what people's local accent is.
PS002|Ah that's good Only Oxford no I'm mine is in in inexplicable because I've lived in so many places and I pick up accents I was born in Lancashire so that's.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|the basis of it all I've had the roughest edges knocked off it when I went to University And the but then I went to live in Northern Ireland so I've got a so picked up a fair bit of Northern Ireland.
PS007|Yes well it does happen when whe.
PS002|Cos it's a hybrid it's an old.
PS007|It.
PS007|it does happen when you move around.
PS002|Yeah it does.
PS007|In I think it happened to me to some extent.
PS002|Well it does if if if you pick up accents some people never change.
PS007|That's true.
PS002|some people doesn't matter where you go they never change But if you are at all I mean yo you I think you pick up reflections.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|You know I haven't been consciously stru striving to change my accent In fact you know I'm consciously now not to become a Welsh accent because if I've got the Welsh accent added to it all it'll be horrendous.
PS002|But er.
PS007|Right.
PS002|I have.
PS002|Yeah.
PS002|isn't it.
PS007|Yes It's at least distinctive.
PS002|It is On the notice you sent out the other day for Monday's meeting.
PS002|Yes.
PS002|I think you put a paragraph first that said maybe we will need to consider our recommendation.
PS007|Yes.
PS002|and the of course you went onto to number one the man's two er group secretary who draws it out I forgot what the other one was.
PS007|Yes.
PS002|Maybe in some thing which at the moment is that the be number one.
PS007|Er which wo which one you mean the.
PS002|Well tha tha that number one be the question on recommendation.
PS007|I see Oh yes Well I was thinking that.
PS002|Yeah But it really is it might have got lost in the paragraph mighten it Cos when the comes underneath.
PS007|I see what you mean.
PS002|It isn't being critical at all but on this position situation that might the first thing that we.
PS007|Oh yes I was assuming that erm a I do I didn't really set it out as a formal agenda just as a.
PS002|Just as a note.
PS007|a reminder like.
PS002|Erm I don't know what the situation will be in the other churches.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|And I must say between us at the moment there wasn't a strong feeling what it's all about.
PS007|Not a strong feeling in favour No.
PS002|No I'm only saying as prepared with.
PS007|Mm.
PS007|Well erm.
PS002|I mean this is nothing to do with a don't worry that's we don't want them thinking that the house is the issue cos it isn't alright The house what rate is.
PS007|Yes.
PS002|Whether there are the.
PS007|No I thi.
PS002|which erm we had an elders meeting on Thursday and between Sunday and Thursday various people have comments and people along.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|on Saturday or Sunday erm there was erm a tale at the elders meeting on su subversion and overall feelings erm erm that we wouldn't.
PS007|Oh That's a pity.
PS002|Yeah well that's erm I mean the only talking is between us at the moment it's just you know If of course on Monday that's a vote a recommendation is taken.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|you know we would accept a reco whatever the Monday's meeting was.
PS007|Yes.
PS002|We we wouldn't mean sticking out of the wood and saying no.
PS007|Yeah but.
PS002|In fact report back just all about meeting and say.
PS007|Bu but o on the other hand yo you've got to se you've to er give the information that you have about the feeling in the church.
PS002|Yes In fact we i it would expressed interest it will be expressed a week on Monday.
PS007|Yes Erm I mean I I I don't know I mean i it's not not it's not my business to even look.
PS002|Oh yes.
PS007|one way or the other I it's simply my business tosortof help the works.
PS002|See mm it that's true yes That if it's as well well before the meeting Monday because at the end of the day you know we we got ta look at the matter going forward isn't it.
PS007|Yes.
PS002|You know is going forward to a week on Sunday and then whatever else happens we're going through the process aren't we And having this all come on Monday thinking that everything is we got ta to the church we're feeling well if we don't go through now where do we go.
PS007|Well I don't I don't think that should influence them too much I mean it one wants to get a settlement quickly.
PS002|Mm.
PS007|but it's more important to get the right person than to do it.
PS002|Well cer.
PS007|quickly.
PS002|well certain things like John there.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|a number of people.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|and then what's it amount to If I use the word aggression.
PS007|Yes I mean they.
PS002|It just came over in his sermon on Sunday morning.
PS007|It's cos I wasn't for that.
PS002|Weren't you.
PS007|No.
PS002|Still he quoted that he'd dealt with in his past.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|And people felt there was an aggressiveness a about him.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|And in trying to bring these four churches together it would be a li you know not.
PS007|A lot of tact may be needed at times yes.
PS002|And you could see them all so nervousness anxiety that I wasn't told about And unfortunately this.
KB0PSUN|First can we have you back in the church.
PS002|we've had this problem in the past with John And with makes.
KB0PSUN|Ooh Ooh.

PS007|Even when.
PS002|Er just more negative Well that seems to be the mood.
PS007|Well what the church meeting's got to decide.
PS002|the church meeting will have to It's the church meeting's final decision.
PS007|I mean even if even i even if the elders recommend positively if the church meeting goes against it well that's it.
PS002|But erm on the other hand we we've got ta try as a group of elders to come together I.
PS007|Mm.
PS002|must admit.
PS007|To see what goes.
PS002|Erm some of us may go to tomorrow and.
