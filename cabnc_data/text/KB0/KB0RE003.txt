PS006|Yes.
PS007|These plastic bags and various.
PS007|That's a nice big greenhouse you've got there.
PS006|Yes er we put that on as a we bought it as a do it yourself job.
PS007|Oh yeah aha.
PS007|how long ago I mean how long has it been there.
PS006|Erm nearly twelve years I think now no must must be more than that.
PS006|ah have to get a pair of scissors.
PS007|What brought you to this part when you went back to.
PS006|Well largely because we couldn't afford a house in the area where we both grew up.
PS007|Where was that.
PS006|The south east London.
PS007|Oh yeah oh right.
PS006|At least I was born in Kent but er brought up in south east London.
PS007|Oh yeah where the whereabouts.
PS006|Erm born in Welling and er and then then we moved to Lewisham.
PS007|Mm mm.
PS006|erm that was immediately after the war you know the first war.
PS007|Right did your erm wife come from the same area.
PS006|Well in a way although her parents were Scotch.
PS007|Oh.
PS006|her mother's family from St Andrews and her father from Dundee.
PS007|Oh but they moved out of London long before.
PS006|Erm oh he came to London to get work.
PS007|Yeah.
PS007|Yeah.
PS006|And what made you choose this particular part of.
PS007|Well one one of my sons is married to er gir girl whose family live in Buckley.
PS006|Oh oh.
PS007|and er originally when when we first sought to retiring retiring we were attracted to the Dales but we couldn't afford that.
PS006|No no this is the great problem of er at the moment oh it was C W M when you retired wasn't it.
PS007|Mm.
PS006|And erm and did they had they got their nanny form of assistance.
PS007|They had but it was erm much less satisfactory as a U R C one.
PS006|Mm.
PS007|but they've changed now they're more or less on the same basis as the U R C.
PS006|Oh.
PS007|but erm it didn't look a very attractive proposition at the time.
PS006|Oh.
PS007|for one thing if we'd taken one of their houses and I'd died first my wife would of been left without a home.
PS006|Oh dear.
PS007|except for going to the er you know they've got that place in Worthing erm.
PS006|Yeah.
PS007|erm.
PS006|Yeah.
PS007|Levers House.
PS006|Yeah.
PS007|but we were neither of us very keen on that.
PS006|No not really no Could you of chosen erm where to have the house or did they have some that had been left for that purpose.
PS007|Erm I'm not really sure we didn't go into it very deeply.
PS006|No.
PS007|Fortunately Ruth had some money from her father which covered buying this house.
PS006|Oh oh.
PS007|erm At that time property was fairly cheap in Bradley.
PS006|Mm mm.
PS007|we got this for seven and a half thousand.
PS006|Oh blimey mm.
PS007|I think it cost more than that now.
PS006|Oh I think so yeah you wouldn't purchase the land that it stands on for that now.
PS007|Mind you it's only a paper profit because you can't rely on it.
PS006|No no Where are you from originally ah.
PS007|London east London East Ham actually I was brought up till I was about seven er in the same area but erm in a place called Beckton.
PS006|Oh that's where the gas works used to be.
PS007|That's right yeah just over not far over the water from er the Woolwich.
PS006|That's right no yes I know not far from where we live really.
PS007|Mm mm and I often tell people that er those who don't come from London don't realise the difference between north and south.
PS006|Mm.
PS007|south London they're two different worlds aren't they In a way.
PS006|Yes.
PS007|for the people who live there they are anyway the river's a great divide.
PS006|Oh yeah Yes it's amazing how a big delight it is despite all the bridges.
PS007|Oh that's right mm You didn't go straight from college overseas.
PS006|Well as near as possible because erm I mean I was appointed to to Africa while I was still in college.
PS007|Oh mm mm.

PS006|That's right yeah yeah Yes our first tour was five it was supposed to be four but we erm er for some reason or other we didn't really want to come home ha four so we stretched to three.
PS006|well we had one more tour after that erm but the and would really of referred to of stayed made the next tour longer than two.

PS007|Zambia.
PS006|Ah.
PS007|I had been into Zambia but not very often.
PS006|Oh.
PS007|In fact when I was stationed in Mule I used to travel through Zambia to get to one of my out stations.
PS006|Oh did you.
PS007|simply because the roads were better that side when it was Northern Rhodesia.
PS006|You crossed on the pontoon did you.
PS007|Yes.
PS006|And then came back over the bridge.
PS007|O over the falls bridge.
PS006|Oh we did that a few times when the the borders were closed with.
PS006|came across pontoon through of course it's a much more e elaborate pontoon now then it was then.
PS007|I'm sure.
PS006|that was er.
PS007|oh it wasn't very elaborate.
PS006|well you could get one one and a half ton truck on it and it was driven across with a couple of.
PS006|engines.
PS007|I can't remember of it.
PS007|the others with a the engine midway.
PS006|I know they did put in er a a much better ferry they.
PS007|Oh yeah yeah.
PS006|and then of course the Americans paid for that road up to.
PS007|mm that's right yeah.
PS006|but er which really was a waste of money it was well it's used a bit for tourism now.
PS007|Mm mm.
PS006|but it's but commercially it was of no importance.
PS007|No.
PS006|but it was er part of the sanctions policy against Rhodesia.
PS007|Yeah that's right.
PS006|Where were you in in Zambia.
PS007|Erm I was we was all the time we were there in er.
PS006|Ah.
PS007|the theological college.
PS006|Mm.
PS007|er the only time I really went any distance was er well I went with er Paul to.
PS006|Oh yeah.
PS007|it was er at a time when this an African district committee sent representatives to the central and visa versa.
PS006|Oh oh.
PS007|Mm.
PS006|That must of been some time ago.
PS007|Yes.
PS006|Nineteen fifty something I think.
PS007|erm of course the economic out in Zambia the economic situations is disastrous now.
PS006|and the drought of course has made it worse.
PS007|Pardon.
PS006|The drought.
PS007|The drought yeah yeah just now the drought seems to be much more widespread now doesn't it and er into South Africa.
PS006|Well I was looking at the er.
PS007|Very bad.
PS006|erm.
PS006|and they were saying that er South Africa's going to have to import food this year.
PS007|That's right yeah.
PS006|normally South Africa feeds these other countries north further south in in bad years.
PS007|Mm mm.
PS006|Yes South Africa has erm er er we have a regular erm A four sheet two two sides of A four sheet erm it was weekly but it's erm a fortnightly.
PS007|Mm.
PS006|newsletter.
PS006|now it's just a news sheet from of Zambia.
PS007|Mm.
PS006|er it's pretty youthful this country with it's.
PS006|Zambian er call it Zambian newspa newspapers so it's very liable as to what you know it's no comm it's not comment at all it's just and erm the last one two weeks ago I think it was indicated that erm South Africa's production of maize would be oh I can't remember but a lot short of what they require themselves.
PS007|Yeah oh it's down to about a quarter of normal it is.
PS006|A quarter is it As low as that.
PS007|Because there are worries that it's going to er effect the outcome of this mad ref referendum you know they the farmers are sort of desperate and they think they need government help and they think they wouldn't get it because of the black government so.
PS006|But erm Botswana's erm doing quite well.
PS007|Oh yes well you see they've got the names.
PS006|Yes that's right but erm unfortunately Zambia's the copper has had the copper and.
