PS002|are there.
PS006|but er I don't think they've got as far as yours have.
PS002|No oh I mean personally I think it would be better for the United Reformed to join up with the shared pastures instead of joining up with the Methodist because the Methodist have got plenty of churches in their area haven't they.
PS006|They have there yes and.
PS002|Yes.
PS006|and the trouble is of course they've the Methodist haven't really joined up themselves.
