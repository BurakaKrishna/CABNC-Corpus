PS090|Well how are things going.
PS097|Yes business okay.
PS097|Mm no.
PS090|No Oh dear dear dear.
PS097|not at all no.
PS090|Is old alright.
PS097|Just about yes yes.
PS090|That must be worrying a lot of people feel like that don't they.
PS097|Yes No it's it's been a very bad eighteen months er.
PS090|Oh dear.
PS097|cos the the business that I was.
PS090|What.
PS097|the business I was a director of.
PS090|Yes.
PS097|er last year went into receivership.
PS090|Oh lord.
PS097|in January.
PS090|Ooh Now does that have a er I I know you lose the income but does it does it penalize you at all.
PS097|Yes it does.
PS090|Oh dear.
PS097|Yes Yeah we've had er the D T I investigating.
PS090|Oh lord.
PS097|cos it was quite a big company.
PS090|Oh.
PS097|But erm it just er hopefully because yeah but really they're just trying to investigate to make sure that we didn't act fraudulently in any way.
PS090|Oh yes Oh good I mean I don't suppose.
PS097|Which which we didn't You know it was the.
PS097|it was the downturn that erm.
PS090|Yes ooh.
PS097|you know that started nineteen nineteen ninety one.
PS090|What was the business what er did you do.
PS097|In in advertising.
PS090|Advertising oh yes.
PS097|An advertising agency.
PS090|Oh.
PS097|Yeah But about a third of the top agencies in our sector all went bust in.
PS090|Good god.
PS097|in the last eighteen months.
PS090|Cos living up here privately in retirement one doesn't realize these things.
PS097|I mean er unemployment in er white collar management area is is is very marked now.
PS090|Is it.
PS097|Yeah it's yes Yes it's really affect affected our our businesses There's so many areas that have contracted so much.
PS090|Yes and i it's a it's long erm.
PS097|It is yes.
PS090|process.
PS097|Yes Affects everything But you know things are going okay.
PS090|But you you managing just just to hold on.
PS097|Just about yes Yeah.
PS090|Cos as you know Ben's in Hong Kong.
PS097|Yes yes.
PS090|He's suddenly swapping from the police to er security in a big bank.
PS097|Oh fascinating.
PS097|Oh.
PS090|Erm I I suppose it'll be a couple of years before he does that but.
PS097|Well yes.
PS090|yes.
PS097|Cos he signed up for five five years didn't he.
PS090|He signed up for three years with an option.
PS097|Mm.
PS090|to do another two.
PS097|Oh I see yes.
PS090|And I think he's going to work out the other two and then go on to this forget the name of it at the moment this bank.
PS097|Mm.
PS090|and er but he doesn't want to come back to England.
PS097|No I was sorry I missed him when he came over last year.
PS090|Last year yes.
PS097|I just had a quick phonecall with him.
PS090|Oh he did speak to you.
PS097|Yes.
PS090|Yes that's right mm.
PS097|Yes.
PS090|Yes see that time went like lightning.
PS097|Yes Such a shame.
PS090|Edmund is still in his job.
PS090|Aha.
PS090|He still hasn't got naturalization but he seems to be fairly erm fairly secure He's a journalist of course.
PS097|Yes Is he confident that he'll get the naturalization.
PS090|Oh yes eventually he will.
PS097|Right.
PS090|Yes.
PS097|W will that be this year or does it take much longer.
PS090|You can never tell.
PS097|Really.
PS090|never tell a girl we know went over at the same time as he did got it this year.
PS097|Really.
PS090|But er it's just the luck of the draw it all depends upon the temper of the particular official that's handling it I think.
PS097|Yes.
PS090|I'll give you a funny article he wrote before you go.
PS097|Oh I'd like to see that.
PS090|But er I'm just trying to think now er Ben er the trouble with it is Edmund can't leave the country whilst he's in a job until he gets naturalization because he's got to get a work permit and an entry permit and everything all the way through.
PS097|Right.
PS090|and again er with the present state of unemployment in America it's unlikely he would get it.
PS097|It's very difficult Yes.
PS090|But he he managed to get his extension to his permit because he had these English connections and the paper he was on reckoned that he was very valuable to them and so they.
PS097|Good.
PS090|they held him.
PS097|Good Well I'm sure he's.
PS090|Are your wife and family well.
PS097|Yes.
PS090|They're happy with you are they.
PS097|Yes they are yes I wouldn't er bestow them er on you even for a short visit though.
PS090|Oh don't be silly.
PS097|The er the s the small one is er.
PS090|Oh you've got two have you.
PS097|Yes he's a real handful.
PS090|Is he Oh dear dear.
PS097|Yes.
PS090|dear dear.
PS097|Yeah he's er he's nearly two and it's a er they're trying times.
PS090|I've had it five times.
PS097|Yes We're expecting another one in June.
PS090|Are you really You.
PS097|That'll be that'll be the third.
PS090|But I had five Every.
PS097|Yes.
PS090|one I said was the last but it.
PS097|Oh I see certainly feel that er we must be mad.
PS097|We must be mad.
PS090|And you're living in Chiswick.
PS097|Yes yes Although we'll have to sell that house.
PS090|Would you What because of the financial position.
PS097|Yes.
PS090|Oh dear oh dear.
PS097|So er we'll have to wait we're we're er we've put an offer in in on a house in Weybridge.
PS090|Oh yes.
PS097|in Surrey Erm not particularly because we we wanted to go to Weybridge but er.
PS090|Cos travelling's expensive isn't it.
PS097|It is actually Fifteen hundred pounds.
PS097|for twenty five minutes' journey to Waterloo But it's got a huge garden which with the two boys I think will be marvellous.
PS090|Oh yes.
PS097|It's very unusual for a even in a a suburban er.
PS090|Yes.
PS097|area Huge garden.
PS090|I know Weybridge slightly.
PS097|Do you Oh.
PS090|Mm Erm but will you make be able to make much profit on the on your old Chiswick house to be able to buy the Weybridge one will that be an economic move.
PS097|Erm we save quite a lot er which is what we're trying to do yes.
PS090|Oh good yes.
PS097|Erm and it's er it's a good area for schools.
PS090|It is a good area for schools mm.
PS097|a a and er it's you know a reasonable community.
PS090|As a matter of fact I knew an old couple that ran a had a nursery school there a big one and a very successful one.
PS097|Yes I imagine it it would be.
PS090|For a number of years they did have but er.
PS097|It's a shame about le leaving Hounslow where Chiswick is.
PS090|Yes.
PS097|because they provide nursery places And.
PS090|Yes.
PS097|so Thomas who's three is at school.
PS090|Oh yes.
PS097|Whereas Surrey doesn't until they're five.
PS090|Oh dear.
PS097|So we'll have to put them.
PS090|Even if they don't you can sometimes find that if you get behind the scenes that there is a way of doing it.
PS097|Yes Yes.
PS090|Got to spin a hard luck story something of that sort.
PS097|Yeah Yes But erm we're very lucky where we are The state schools are very good.
PS090|Are they in Chiswick.
PS097|They do seem very good Very pleased with them But erm it's difficult living in London now The erm you really are aware I don't know if you get up to London much.
PS090|Do occasionally yes.
PS097|Yes but the erm the atmosphere.
PS090|Oh I hate London it's awful.
PS097|Chris Christmas day I had a real chest erm and mouth and everything.
PS090|I can quite believe it.
PS097|And it's erm it's so oppressive and we really worry about it with the children.
PS090|Yes well I can see that mm I er I very much dislike London We've got still got a little house there.
PS097|Yes.
PS090|and er so it gets sort of.
PS097|At the organ works.
PS090|Yes.
PS097|Yeah.
PS090|It's a bolt hole.
PS097|Mhm.
PS090|but I very seldom use it.

PS08Y|That'll be nice.
PS097|I I think so.

PS097|It's not it's not out of choice entirely because er the business that I was has has gone very very badly over the last eighteen months.
PS08Y|Do you mean that type of business or that particular firm.
PS097|Both.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS097|Yeah But the particular firm I was a director of went into receivership.
PS08Y|Oh dear.
PS097|beginning of last year it was about.
PS08Y|Oh that's.
PS097|a year ago now and erm so er I mean fortunately it was bought er as a going concern.
PS08Y|Good.
PS097|erm but everyone's financial position er suffered as a result.
PS08Y|Yes Mm.
PS097|So I'm not as on as good a contract.
PS08Y|You're not.
PS097|No.
PS08Y|No.
PS097|But them I'm lucky to have have a job really.
PS08Y|Well I mean these were the kind of jobs that weren't replaceable weren't they really.
PS097|Well.
PS08Y|In a slump.
PS097|yes that's it I mean there's so little business around that erm.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS097|so.
PS08Y|It was it was somewhat a good thing that somebody was prepared to buy it.
PS097|Yeah.
PS08Y|Now I'll pull this forward a bit erm Ian.
PS097|Sorry is this your seat.
PS08Y|and no it isn't no no no not at all Now I'm going to leave those there.
PS097|Yes Alright.

PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|that's right Aha So you've got to leave that now.
PS097|Yes Yes.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|But.
PS08Y|Well this is life when you're young.
PS097|i i it is really Yeah I mean we we're fatalistic about it it's I I think it is only a a phase.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|Things will change.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|I'm sure we've learnt er I've learnt er business er er secures as a result of it.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|erm so positive about it.
PS08Y|Yes It's the only way to be really isn't it.
PS097|Well yeah yes.
PS08Y|Have you got a house ready for you in erm Weybridge.
PS097|Well we're buying it from an ol elderly chap.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|erm he's been in it twenty years and er he's had it on the market for some time It m probably not as long as a year but it's quite a while.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|er and he's accepted our offer.
PS08Y|Good.
PS097|but he doesn't seem actually willing to move out.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS097|er which I can understand really.
PS08Y|You one gets very fond of a house really.
PS097|I think he's he's split up with his wife.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS097|although he must be sixty odd erm and it's obviously a very difficult time for him.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|Erm so he's keeping us in limbo really.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|which is a bit infuriating cos er Alison's due our third in.
PS08Y|My.
PS097|at the end of June.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS097|so er we have to be decided either way.
PS08Y|yes.
PS097|by then.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|Oh we're quite happy to rent for a while.
PS08Y|I was going to say that's the alternative I suppose.
PS097|Yes yes.
PS08Y|to yes.
PS097|yes.
PS08Y|And you might even have to do this er for an interim period or something.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|until he decides.
PS090|Can you get.
PS097|yes.
PS090|places to rent alright.
PS097|Yes you can actually yes Yes.
PS08Y|Mm yes do help yourself Ian Erm so where would he be meaning to go if he does let you.
PS097|He wants to move down to a smaller house in Weybridge.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|Er which we're told shouldn't be difficult to find.
PS08Y|Er no no.
PS097|So erm you know hopefully that will be the case.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|But erm I don't think he er realizes how difficult it is.
PS08Y|No.
PS097|to set up.
PS08Y|No.
PS097|a move and that really he's quite fortunate to have a buyer somewhere within the price he wanted.
PS08Y|Indeed.
PS097|Cos we've all you know we've all not got as much for our houses as we want.
PS08Y|No that's very true That's true.
PS08Y|Mm Oh well let's hope that he will I mean the thing is at the age of sixty he has no conception of what it's like to be your age at this period.
PS097|Mm Well you know he hasn't bought a hou sold a house within the last ten years.
PS08Y|Mhm mm.
PS097|which we've done a number of times.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|and it's not a pleasant it's a very stressful business.
PS08Y|I'm sure I'm sure it is I don't know how we escaped it so much but we have you see Because we lived on the business that was.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|er a foregone conclusion and we never sought to move from there until he retired did we.
PS097|Mm.
PS090|No.
PS08Y|So one doesn't know er exactly what it's like to do it.
PS097|No No.
PS08Y|Mm Gosh And tell us about the children how old are they.
PS097|Harry is erm he'll be two in June.
PS08Y|Mhm.
PS097|then Thomas will be four in August.
PS08Y|Oh I see so they're nice spaces.
PS097|Yes there'll be two years between all of them.
PS08Y|Yes Yes.
PS097|So which Alison feels is erm er you know the right sort of time.
PS08Y|Ideal really.
PS097|for her.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|which is obviously important.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|And erm they haven't had Thomas doesn't remember not having Harry around.
PS08Y|That's nice.
PS097|whereas we've got friends who've got older children well a little bit there's yeah three or four years between.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|and they get er old enough to be er quite er happy that they're on you know c centre of attention.
PS08Y|Exactly.
PS097|which er Thomas hasn't.
PS08Y|It sours the relationship a bit.
PS097|Yeah it does a bit.
PS08Y|Yes aha.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|Ah well I I is this going to be if it's a boy is this going to be a Benjamin.
PS097|I don't know actually could be.
PS08Y|you've got two boys.
PS097|Mhm.
PS08Y|and so.
PS090|the last of the tribe.
PS08Y|Oh the last of the tribe.
PS090|Yes.
PS08Y|Well I think I think you know what I mean.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|Erm that's what we did finally in desperation with Ben wasn't it.
PS097|You decided to.
PS08Y|He was five number five Erm it would be nice to have a little girl then now wouldn't it.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|really.
PS097|I'd it's funny because I always wanted a girl.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|but now I I wouldn't know I don't feel I'd know what to do.
PS08Y|Mm well this is just how Ruth was.
PS097|Yes.
PS090|got no choice.
PS097|Mm No that's right.
PS08Y|This is what Ruth er felt cos she had two boys.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|but erm and she thought I shan't know how to deal with a girl at all.
PS097|Mhm.
PS08Y|which is a funny thing for a woman to think isn't it.
PS097|Well Alison feels the same yes.
PS08Y|Does she.
PS097|Yes yes she does Yeah.
PS08Y|It is odd isn't it But.
PS097|And then she had.
PS08Y|Oh oh she adores her and of course she said it's wonderful I don't have to keep struggling to get boys out of their trousers.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|This of course is passing now because the girl's.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|four isn't she Noel Four and.
PS097|Really Gosh.
PS08Y|she'll be five in April and that's the youngest one.

PS097|Oh lovely.
PS08Y|That's nice isn't it.
PS097|children yes it's great.
PS08Y|Mm So Ruth I think as far as barring accidents will regard that as being her final.
PS097|Right.
PS08Y|They live in Wells.
PS097|Oh do they.
PS08Y|in Somerset Mm.
PS097|Yes Oh lovely I don't know that area but.

PS08Y|Is that the only child they have at the present time.
PS097|Yes Yes.
PS08Y|Mhm Mm.
PS097|Yeah.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|All they can cope with I think.
PS08Y|And of course he'll be bilingual.
PS097|Well he is.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|He's quite slow as a result which is quite common apparently.
PS08Y|Is it.
PS097|with er children who are brought up with both languages.
PS08Y|Mm Mm.
PS097|Erm bec they don't speak either very well to start off with.
PS08Y|And how old is he did you say.
PS097|He's two and a half.
PS08Y|Oh well it's early It's such an advantage to them later on I think.
PS097|Oh well a absolutely yes.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|Er he because Toni Hamish's wife.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|is half French so.
PS08Y|Is she.
PS097|I'm I'm sure he'll her pick up.
PS08Y|Get three Trilingual.
PS097|Yes Cos they spend quite a lot of time they spend their holidays in France.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|So I'm sure that confuses him even more at this stage.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS090|Course it does.
PS097|Yeah.
PS08Y|Yes but in the end it does seem to work I was always a bit doubtful about it.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|erm er you know whether it could vu confuse children or not but in fact it doesn't seem to with John's children does it.
PS090|No no His.
PS08Y|They use.
PS090|his wife is German.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|Mhm.
PS08Y|And they use both languages quite freely.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|In fact she gets rather uptight because erm during the year at school when they're speaking English most of the time.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|which is very natural and so she ships them off to Germany to the relatives.
PS097|To put them straight.
PS08Y|Aye.
PS097|That's quite right I think because it is a good good thing.
PS08Y|That's right Well it is.
PS097|I wo I won't thanks.
PS08Y|Will you have another one.
PS097|No thank you.
PS08Y|Well help yourself then if you want one Mm But.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|of course the the the slump is also not the slump the recession is also er operative in Italy is it.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|It's everywhere Ian why do people.
PS090|It's worldwide.
PS097|Well.
PS08Y|make such a fuss about it erm I mean politically.
PS097|Well yes well I suppose it's.
PS08Y|Everybody's having to cope with it.
PS097|coming up to an election time and.
PS08Y|Of course.
PS097|everyone er.
PS08Y|They're bound to use it.
PS097|bound to use anything they can.
PS090|Mm.
PS097|er any angle they can get get a grip of.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|But er yes no it is th I mean they had a lot of business from banks and areas like that.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|which of course have lost a lot of money in the last year or two.
PS08Y|That's right of course They have they will be drawing back on most things.
PS097|Yeah.
PS08Y|But in fact they're the people aren't they who need bilingual people on the staff.
PS097|Yes they are They're much much better I mean y er you know although they're in recession I I think there's you know in this country.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|we we're owned now our company by a French agency group and erm none of our directors are are learning French.
PS08Y|Isn't it extraordinary.
PS097|And yet you've got people who run restaurants small businesses of that sort erm just general businessmen who want you know know they have to speak English.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|And they're just doing it as a matter of course over there.
PS090|Yes.
PS08Y|They all seem to have more drive than our people what's the matter with us.
PS097|It's certainly in the in that area it's the cosmopolitan business.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|attitude er and also it's complacency because we can.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|you can get away with it You know all the meetings.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS097|are held in English.
PS08Y|Mm Mm.
PS097|And er the French speak very good English.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|erm so there's there's not enough incentive there.
PS08Y|No.
PS097|And I have to say that er I don't But I I I I ou really I I know I'll have to be thrown into the situation of having to do it.
PS08Y|You'd better get on with it and do it now.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|But of course the beauty of it is you've done it at school haven't you.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|And once you've done it at school it comes back with a bit of an effort quite quickly.
PS097|Yeah I've got a reasonable vocabulary.
PS08Y|Yes Yes.
PS097|but never really spoken it at all I mean we never did any French trips.
PS08Y|Didn't you.
PS097|was useless for languages when I was there.
PS08Y|Was it.
PS097|Yes absolutely hopeless We never did any trips of that nature at all actually.
PS08Y|And what was the teaching system Er had they by the time you were still at school come on to that new erm er system where you speak a lot more.
PS097|No.
PS08Y|No You've done it out of grammar books.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|Yes I remember.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|it was yeah vocabulary tests and that sort of thing which.
PS08Y|Mm Mm.
PS097|you know er well it's er it's a middle ages approach to.
PS08Y|Well actually the one thing you can say about it is it is a good grounding for what you now go on and do.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|because erm wherever you go now for refresher lessons they will use the modern method.
PS097|Yeah.
PS08Y|And that's that will build on that foundation.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|You'll be astonished how quickly it'll come back.
PS097|Mm mm.
PS08Y|You really will.
PS097|Hopefully.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS090|Yes all we had when I was at school were l l yards of verbs and yards of nouns we never knew how to put the two lots together.
PS097|No.
PS08Y|That's true.
PS090|Yeah.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|The people who had the imagination or ability to do it where the ones that could speak the languages the ones that didn't.
PS090|Yes it was.
PS097|made no connection at all.
PS090|Mm Because I knew a lot of nouns and a lot of verbs I could get by when I went to Algeria in.
PS097|Mm.
PS090|nineteen forty but it was I envied those who could really speak.
PS097|Yeah.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS090|But erm if you see some officer floundering for the word for a cabbage or something of that sort I could provide the word and he provided the conversation.
PS097|Yes.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|Yes Well actually you're going to a centre aren't you er in where there will be evening classes and that sort of opportunity.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|I think probably.
PS097|It's it's it's well erm served for for.
PS08Y|Mm I would imagine it's quite well led.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|Ya And you'll have no problem yes.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|Aha.
PS097|I'll have to give up my art classes then which is.
PS08Y|Art.
PS097|haven't been doing them recently but when I've been able to get a er an evening away that's what I.
PS08Y|Mm mm.
PS097|spend my time doing over the past few years.
PS08Y|Yes but will it rule it out altogether do you think if you've got to do the French.
PS097|Well A Alison goes out for one evening so that means I have to get back early for that evening.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|and then if I I go out for another one that means two evening evenings back.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|leaving the office at five thirty on the dot and of course.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|I I can't do that more than twice a week.
PS08Y|No No I see Your work itself is going to take more time than that.
PS097|Well yes.
PS08Y|Is that just at first or is it regularly.
PS097|No I mean it's it's always been the case.
PS08Y|Mm Mm Ya.

PS097|I've not really moved around a lot.
PS08Y|No No.
PS097|in the actual function.
PS08Y|No.
PS097|Just sort of progressed up the ladder I suppose.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS090|Mhm.
PS097|so yes.
PS08Y|Yes Oh well you can only make the best of the thing you've got and that's the best thing to do rather than.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|unless you're forced to switch er horses you know in in mid stream.
PS097|Yeah Well i i I always say that er it always comes a surprise that I was good at anything And I always think back to the er the time I think Edmund and I were sitting in the back garden here and deciding that we'd go off and join the paratroopers.
PS08Y|Really.
PS097|because we weren't going to get any O levels.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS097|And that was about all we were good for.
PS08Y|I'm sorry.
PS08Y|How funny But in fact you did get your O levels didn't you.
PS097|So I remember well I got a handful.
PS08Y|Yes I remember.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS090|And Edmund got a B A.
PS097|Yeah.
PS08Y|Ah but wait a minute not until after that was it.
PS097|yes.
PS08Y|He got his O levels but that was it.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|Decided he'd had enough and I suppose you had too.
PS097|Mm well.
PS08Y|Did you stay on for As.
PS097|Yes I did.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS097|But again I you know I always had the ability to er to know to scrape by.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|or knowing what the minimum required was.
PS097|and er pitching myself at just over that point I think.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS097|Which I suppose is some sort of ability.
PS08Y|Well it's a it's a in a way that's quite true.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|Yes it saves the er er the use of excess energy when you don't need to doesn't it.
PS097|Yes That's right.
PS08Y|Ah Edmund was lucky because he got this chance to do a university you see in.
PS097|Mm.
PS08Y|in er New Hampshire wasn't it.
PS097|Yes.
PS08Y|Erm.
