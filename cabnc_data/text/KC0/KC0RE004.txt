PS095|no no no no i no it's a i i it's old trouble.
PS08Y|Yes I know I know.
PS095|It's old trouble I think.
PS08Y|I know.
PS095|he's more interested in women than anything else.
PS08Y|Oh It's sad isn't it It really is it's sad.
PS095|I don't know he come he said to me er we we well he come over you see when I come home from hospital he sa he had to report to come and see me he was a long while before he did come But er he he hopped on one day and er had a talk with him and so on and took my temperature and pulse and that this that and other he said well I'll call again he said when I'm by but he never did.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS095|He never called.
PS08Y|Mm I don't think he.
PS095|I had to ring.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS095|And I said to him I said well I hope I don't mind er me ringing the doctor well he said no that's what we're here for But he said I've got three hours of paperwork Well that's nothing to do with it.
PS08Y|Absolutely Absolutely.
PS095|Nothing to do with it.
PS08Y|I mean it doesn't stop him from going shooting and fishing does it.
PS095|Oh no.
PS095|No no that's the thing I think he's a little bit envious because er I took those meadows back you see.
PS08Y|Possibly yes.
PS095|Cos he used to go shooting there and and they went in there and they shouldn't of done because Michael told them I'd taken meadows back and he sa he said when Tony told them they they'd been there shooting he said well they're they're out of bounds.
PS08Y|Mm Mm.
PS095|He said I told them that.
PS08Y|Mm Mm.
PS095|But they took advantage the boys did and they don't care at all.
PS08Y|Ye yes that's right mm.
PS095|They take liberties.
PS08Y|Yes they do they do it's a shame.
PS095|I think that a little bit apprehensive on things like that and course when he saw Tony asked whether ga whether he could go and Tony said no I'm sorry Doc but that he said I've got my ponies and things there and I don't want people shooting there.
PS08Y|Of course not No.
PS095|There's them foals from round the back they don't want them.

PS095|Oh yes.
PS08Y|true.
PS095|But they th th th they just walk on they don't have to pay anything.
PS08Y|No.
PS08Y|No No.
PS095|Walk over you.
PS08Y|Well they just think they're in a privileged position Stanley.
PS095|Yes.

PS08Y|That's right.
PS095|There's a no I don't think he's too obliged as he should be.
PS08Y|No he's not a I don't think he's as a as some.
PS095|They tell me that is a is a a lot better value.
PS08Y|He is wonderful.
PS095|They.
PS08Y|He.
PS095|say he's a nice little fellow.
PS08Y|My gosh he's wonderful Everybody wants him you know.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|I should think his list is absolutely full by now.
PS095|Yes of course.
PS08Y|Erm the first time I met him was when he was doing a very tricky stitching job I took Mollie up.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|because she'd cut her leg.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|and er I took her up there and her si skin is like tissue paper.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|I don't know how that man managed to get the two edges to meet but he did a wonderful job on it And he was so nice to her when he was doing it.
PS095|Yes he's a nice person of.
PS08Y|You're very nice.
PS095|then Mrs erm er you know who had the mu.
PS08Y|Oh yes.
PS095|she think a lot of him.
PS08Y|Lucky girl.
PS095|Yeah.
PS08Y|Those people who live there in up in Framlingham are very lucky.

PS08Y|And those people who live near enough.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|you see to the main surgery.
PS095|Well of course when is out they they give you the the's number.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS095|in fact one time when they was out they give me a number I go and I got.
PS08Y|Oh yes Yes.
PS095|Well and I had er er erm erm what's the name Ha What do you call them.
PS08Y|A tummy upset.
PS095|No Skin.
PS08Y|Oh not erm shingles.
PS095|Shingles I had a touch.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS095|of shingles.
PS08Y|Gosh Mm.
PS095|And I said to him he said what's the matter And I told him I said I've got shingles so I said well I got them he said and red round the stomach Ha ha ha he said I thought to myself not so much of the ha ha ha That's what he's li er wasn't a way to tell nobody was it.
PS08Y|No it wasn't You see that's another one.
PS095|He didn't feel it did he.
PS08Y|No he didn't feel absolutely.
PS095|No.
PS08Y|Stanley No that's not.
PS095|I thought to myself who's this then That's something I don't sa not so matter that I could have told him.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS095|That isn't a way to get through to people.
PS08Y|No it isn't No it's not.
PS095|Cos after all we don't go private but we're paying.
PS08Y|Tha abs.
PS095|And I've payed for years and years for myself and four other people besides.
PS08Y|Mm Mm.
PS095|No some.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS095|of them get too snooty in a way.
PS08Y|Yes they get they're a bit less committed I think the.
PS095|And as you say with well if he can go fishing and shooting I don't know about that they take priority.
PS08Y|Yes Yes that's true Mhm There's another very nice one there he's the latest to have come erm.
PS095|What in.
PS08Y|oh and he's just.
PS095|at Framlingham.
PS08Y|Yes And he's very young he's i I met him twice when I was with people who were dying.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|and erm in fact yes but both of just had died and we sent for the doctor and it's.
PS095|Aha.
PS08Y|it was he who came and erm he was absolutely marvellous I thought his manner was just right.
PS095|Makes all the difference doesn't it.
PS08Y|Oh yes It does make a lot of.
PS095|I mean.
PS08Y|difference yes.
PS095|a person like that can help another person to get well can't they.
PS08Y|They can They can I mean th there is something to be said for the manner towards you isn't there.
PS095|Ooh yes.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|That's true.
PS095|I mean when you look forward to seeing the doctor and one thing and another and saying have a conversation with them that's a different story in n it.
PS08Y|That's true.
PS095|And buck you up a bit.
PS08Y|Oh absolutely.
PS095|That's something you.
PS08Y|Absolutely Yes.
PS095|if you think to yourself well if I can have a a quarter of an hour's chat with him that'd be worth something.
PS08Y|That's right That's true.
PS095|Yes I don't know why some of them get like that well of course they shouldn't be doctors any how And tha tha th th a doctor should have a nice personality.
PS08Y|He should I think in some cases Stanley not only in the me medical profession the more people are paid the less committed they seem to be to the job.
PS095|Yes they do they get independent.
PS08Y|Yes They begin to feel that the job is there so that they can earn a living rather than that they are doing the job itself.
PS095|That's right yes Yes.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS095|Th th er theirselves they take priority not the patient.
PS08Y|That's what I feel Yes.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|I'm sorry about it because you know how I feel about the medical profession and the nursing.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|profession.
PS095|Yes.
PS08Y|Ye I mean I'm passionately keen But erm I I think some of them let us down a bit Mm.
PS095|Yes Well there you are I don't know whether it's wrong Course they drop onto you any old time if they come but if they can't.
PS08Y|Oh yes if they want to come it doesn't matter if it's convenient to you or not does it.
PS095|Not a bit of it Not a bit of it Oh no.
PS08Y|That's true.
PS095|not a bit of it.
PS08Y|That's true.
PS095|Well I mean after all they want er an appointment.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS095|But you don't get no appointment.
PS08Y|That's right you don't.
PS095|Oh no You see.
PS08Y|That's true.
PS095|you take second place definitely.
PS08Y|Yes I'm sorry.
PS095|Well.
PS08Y|it is true with some.
PS095|I mean after all.
PS08Y|of them.
PS095|you're we're their customers.
PS08Y|Ah that's right.
PS095|That's their living in n it.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS095|Withou they need er er anyone like ourselves well er er they'd have nothing to do.
PS08Y|That's right Absolutely.
PS08Y|And of course they're not so hard pressed as people are in these big cities.
PS095|Oh no.
PS08Y|You know they have a nicer time of it here altogether don't they.
PS095|Oh undoubtedly Undoubtedly.
PS08Y|Yes They do.
