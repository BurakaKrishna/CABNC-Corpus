PS08Y|What we were talking about or what I think is interesting is your experience from your early days in horse shoeing has stood you in good stead for the revival of interest in driving erm if you'd like to tell us a bit more about that I'd love to hear it cos I'm never tired of that.
PS092|Yeah well er the shoeing today is completely different to what it was when I started nearly sixty year ago In them days horses were they were all working hors driving horses you hardly ever see a riding horse Er the ones they did ride were the ones they used to drive at erm ah down the two jars but er and that was a completely different way of life then to what that is now Er.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS092|er the horses that are shod today you see they all riding horses no very few working horses.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Er but now the.
PS08Y|It's and that's your hobby isn't it.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Er where before that was the horse was equivalent for a motor today.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|So that was a living.
PS093|It did the.
PS092|Er.
PS093|job of a tractor it did the.
PS093|job a van a lorry.
PS092|Lorry.
PS093|a car everything.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Ah every form of transport.
PS092|Transport.
PS093|when you think about it.
PS08Y|Yes Mhm And is it.
PS092|But now.
PS08Y|different type of horse that makes it different for shodding.
PS092|Oh yes.
PS08Y|today.
PS092|Oh yeah.
PS08Y|Not the question of the same horses doing a different job.
PS092|No that's a different type of horse er.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|er the old fashioned working horses er practically extinct.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|And the shires are still there fairly strong still er some of course has now gone onto the rare breeds.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS092|Er registered you see Er Welsh colts and things of that nature are coming back a bit now they are building up now er but.
PS093|But would I be right in saying that the everyday working horse the sort of general purpose working horse that people used years ago people such as carriers they would use horses which were crossbreeds wouldn't they Not.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|not a purebred anything.
PS092|Not a pure no.
PS093|They'd be good old heavy honest rough.
PS092|Yeah Yeah yeah.
PS093|hard working horses.
PS092|That's right.
PS093|Not things of beauty really at all.
PS092|No No ooh no no.
PS093|And you hardly ever see that type now do you Gypsies.
PS092|No.
PS093|have them You still.
PS08Y|They were.
PS093|see gypsies with that sort.
PS08Y|built for strength.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|for the.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|jobs.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Work.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Were they.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Purely for.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|work and hardiness.
PS092|And they're ornaments today they aren't working horses.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS092|You put these horses into hard work today they'd be dead within three months.
PS08Y|Would they.
PS092|Ooh yes Yeah.
PS093|Yes the whole scene has altered And er as I say observing this and watching Hector's work and how things have gone on over the years er as you know there's been a tremendous revival of interest in driving so many people have er restored carts or had new ones built and erm the young farriers who've never had the experience with driving horses they have run into problems with erm keeping them going soundly and overcoming problems which crop up when horses are driven on the road a lot.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS093|Would you like to tell us a bit more about that.
PS092|Well yeah that is I'm I mean that's a completely different er er laxing of the it's completely different Er when you're riding a horse you see the weight is all on the back er whichever tendency do and what we call the gait er.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|is the hind legs in the front.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|they have a tendency to open them make them wider apart.
PS08Y|Oh yes.
PS092|by the backs.
PS08Y|G A I T.
PS093|That's right that kind of gait.
PS092|By the back and swop them you see Well er with a driving horse that's completely opposite because yo your vehicle behind the horse is pushing against it.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|and have a tendency to punt the back.
PS08Y|Really.
PS092|so that pushes the legs fo closer together do you see.
PS08Y|Good heavens.
PS093|They're more likely to.
PS092|And then they're more likely to hit they're more likely to hit.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|the front legs with the back legs.
PS08Y|Really.
PS092|when they're going especially going down hill.
PS093|And of course there's a word in the trade for that isn't there.
PS092|Yeah Forging.
PS08Y|What is it.
PS093|It's what now there's a.
PS08Y|Forging.
PS093|completely.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|different use for the word forging.
PS08Y|Now is it related to forging ahead in any way Oh do is that where forging ahead comes.
PS093|I.
PS08Y|from When you're really pushing.
PS092|Yeah yeah pushing.
PS093|It might well be It might.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|well be I would say the term.
PS092|And and then they can.
PS093|forging ahead has come from the use of that word in relation to horses.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Yes.
PS093|I would say because that.
PS092|Yeah probably.
PS093|dates back many many years doesn't.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|it.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes Because they.
PS092|That's it.
PS093|do do it when they're pushing ahead.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|they they hit the front foot with the hind one.
PS08Y|Good Lord.
PS093|Occasionally you.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|hear them do it.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS093|when they're driving it's quite a sharp.
PS092|Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
PS093|crack you.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|hear.
PS08Y|It's amazing.
PS092|Mm.
PS093|Er so that's that's completely different do you see So the styling of shoeing is different.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS092|Completely different.
PS093|If they do it too much then the farrier's not doing a good job.
PS092|Job.
PS093|and his job.
PS08Y|Really.
PS093|is to re-balance the shoe so that er it just misses.
PS092|Miss.
PS093|the front foot as it comes forward If the.
PS08Y|Right.
PS093|if the horse is travelling fast on the road he's at the trot I mean it isn't.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|the done thing for driving horses to canter or gallop on the road they never ever should.
PS08Y|No.
PS093|Erm but at the trot when th the the legs are moving the diagonals are moving so of course the front and the hind foot come very close together.
PS08Y|Ah that's it.
PS093|at one point in the gait.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|and if the.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|shoe is slightly wrongly balanced or the foot is slightly wrongly trimmed then you get these troubles you.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|also get what we call brushing don't you.
PS092|Brushing When they.
PS093|Tell Edith about that.
PS092|when they hit both legs together like the hind legs when they they'll hit each other they'll hit one hind leg.
PS093|They really they.
PS092|with other one you see.
PS093|They really.
PS08Y|Ooh.
PS093|wear.
PS092|They give it a.
PS093|a a a sore place.
PS08Y|Ooh yes.
PS093|on the.
PS092|Yes.
PS08Y|Like us banging our ankles like that.
PS092|That's it.
PS093|Yes Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|They do it on what we call the coronet.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|which is of course the little junction between the skin and the hair.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Ooh.
PS093|Very tender place It's like the quick of our nail.
PS08Y|Ooh yes.
PS093|where the.
PS08Y|I can imagine.
PS093|tissue grows from And they do.
PS092|And on the front.
PS093|damage their coronet.
PS092|On the front one they do it on the knee which is the er do you see which is higher up.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|But the knee comes sort of out.
PS092|Out.
PS08Y|doesn't it Er inside.
PS092|Yeah Yeah.
PS08Y|there's a.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|nobble.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|on the yes.
PS092|Yeah yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah so and that's what they call cutting.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|Really.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|You'd never dream And so people who go and usually into horses need to know all these or else they're going to be very unfair to the horse.
PS092|Well er.
PS093|They should know about it.
PS092|They should know it.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|They should know it But er.
PS093|But it mainly it's the farrier's job to know.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|But course they don't er.
PS093|It's his responsibility.
PS092|they don't do enough work to really create any problems today do you see what they're to do somebody will say ooh we'll go out for a ride.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|they're out half an hour.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Hey We'll go out for a drive probably out an hour whereas years ago the horse used to come out the stable at seven in the morning he wouldn't go back till probably five at night.
PS08Y|Course.
PS092|Probably later than that.
PS08Y|Mhm.
PS092|He'd go the driving horses they'd probably go to Wickham market Monday do you see the sale on the Monday they'd go to Ipswich on the Tuesday er Wednesday they'd go to Bury er and Ailsworth.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|And they really earned their.
PS092|Then they'd go to Norwich.
PS093|keep.
PS08Y|Full time job.
PS093|Ooh they worked hard.
PS092|And then they'd go to Norwich on the Saturday.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS092|I mean they'd they'd they'd be doing probably anything up to forty mile a day weren't they.
PS08Y|Would be Yeah.
PS092|Yes And I mean that was six days a week.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|But now they do er twenty minutes they think they'd have done wonders.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Or go from pub to pubs.
PS092|You know.
PS093|that's about it.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|And you think of these for instance Prince.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Phillip who is.
PS093|Yeah Yeah.
PS08Y|presumably those horses don't do long spells of that sort.
PS092|No.
PS08Y|of driving.
PS092|No No.
PS08Y|They'll be exercised in other ways I imagine will they.
PS092|Exercised yeah they're exercised normal exercise during the week and then when they do these events do you see But of course if you go back far enough do you see on these four in hands were were going from town to town weren't they I mean they were they were mail originally weren't they.
PS08Y|On the stage coaches yes.
PS093|Mhm.
PS092|Stage coaches.
PS093|Mhm.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Er on the horses that's understandable they can start off and probably don't knock theirself but there's a time they'd done twenty or thirty mile pulling a load.
PS093|They're tired.
PS092|They're tired.
PS093|Mhm.
PS092|er and then they start and that's when the trouble starts.
PS08Y|Just as we do walking a bit less.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|carefully.
PS092|Yeah Yeah.
PS093|Yes Yes the same.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|thing applies.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS093|Exactly.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS093|And.
PS08Y|What about er in those days er possibly a few still when erm let's you said gypsies didn't you.
PS092|Mm.
PS08Y|or let's say just erm odd tradesmen had a horse or a pony or whatever it was pulling a cart round the streets with vegetables or with with er coal.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|or something what about the amount of care they would get from a farrier those horses.
PS092|Well they they got reasonable care because like I said that was that was the the owner knew that er that was his livelihood then.
PS08Y|That's the thing I suppose yes.
PS092|and he treated his horse well I mean a lot of these horseman good horseman treated the horse better than they did the wife.
PS08Y|I wouldn't be surprised about that.
PS092|Ooh yes.
PS08Y|Living in the East.
PS092|Yes.
PS08Y|End I wouldn't be surprised.
PS092|Mm mm.
PS08Y|at that.
PS092|Oh yes Er and they thought of I mean they thought the world of their their animals and but.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|er when you were in the trade like mine if you didn't do a good job the man never come back to you there was a there was a blacksmith farrier in every village.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Some villages had two.
PS08Y|Mhm.
PS092|And if you didn't do the job properly you didn't get the job and if you didn't get the job you went hungry.
PS08Y|Course.
PS092|So that er that made you do it properly.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Yes they were a.
PS092|And there was no there was no if you hadn't earned a shilling you'd got nothing to eat had you.
PS08Y|That's right Necessity being a good driver.
PS093|Absolutely.
PS092|Well yeah Yeah.
PS093|Erm Hector often quotes one particular instance which illustrates that very well er a as recently as your time after you were er er shoeing.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|in your own business and everything er people often say what did you used to charge And it was six and eight pence for a set of shoes on a.
PS092|Six and eight pence yes.
PS093|heavy horse a land horse such as a Suffolk as most of them were erm but times were so tight that there was a farmer who used to send his horse with his horseman right past here and go another mile down the road to to the next village to Kettleborough where there was ano there were two farriers there.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|and one of them was doing them a halfpenny cheaper.
PS08Y|Ooh.
PS093|Six and seven pence halfpenny.
PS092|Halfpenny.
PS093|And the farmer thought that it would.
PS092|Payed him to do it.
PS093|to send them an extra mile each way and the extra.
PS08Y|Really.
PS093|time that took to get them shod a halfpenny cheaper And things were as tight as that.
PS08Y|As tight as that.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Mm.
PS093|So.
PS08Y|I suppose now would could that possibly be called a false economy What was he using up.
PS093|It probably was.
PS08Y|time.
PS092|Well if that was I meant that would be today.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|but er in them days there was no such thing as false economy I'd and I economy didn't come into it.
PS093|No.
PS092|else he'd of I mean.
PS093|No.
PS092|er.
PS093|People didn't set the same cost value on time as they.
PS092|Time.
PS08Y|I was going to say time.
PS093|do now.
PS08Y|didn't count in the same.
PS092|No and er.
PS093|It really didn't seem to.
PS08Y|No.
PS093|it's very funny that.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS092|If you're if you hadn't earned the money well you didn't go into it in detail and get the time and motion study man.
PS08Y|No.
PS092|in to look at the job did you Just thought.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS092|well we'd better pull ourselves together and see if we can put this right.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS092|Er you never really went into it to see where you had lost the money.
PS08Y|No No.
PS092|Er but you just grabbed a little harder so that you made ends meet.
PS08Y|That's right By the result you.
PS092|Yeah Yeah.
PS08Y|would see that you had to work a bit.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|harder and.
PS092|There was no no working out to see how you could do anything cheaper.
PS08Y|No No.
PS092|No.
PS08Y|Aha.
PS093|But any economy that was made or in the early days of Hector's er business I know was always saving material rather than time.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Erm and the instinct remains doesn't it.
PS092|Oh yeah.
PS093|Your your instinct is to save.
PS092|a bit harder.
PS093|an odd bit of se steel or iron off a bar which the modern man would say well there's.
PS093|no point in saving that because by the.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS093|time you've looked.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|for it and found it when you want it er it would have paid you to cut a bit off a new bar.
PS08Y|That's it Time costing as much.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|as it now does.
PS093|Time now.
PS092|Yeah that's right.
PS093|is er is the main driving thing but in your early days it was material every time.
PS092|Oh material every time.
PS093|Erm tell Edith.
PS092|Labour.
PS093|about some of the er er oh normal economies that were made like erm making odd links.
PS092|Well oh well the horse.
PS093|into staples and all that sort of thing.
PS092|well the horse shoes you see we used to we used to weld one and a half old horse shoes together in the fire to make one new one again.
PS08Y|Really.
PS092|Ooh yes They weren't thrown.
PS08Y|One turned the other way on top.
PS092|We.
PS08Y|of the other.
PS092|used to get one shoe and a ta in the middle so that so that cut the half new one.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|turn it over on itself then the other one we used to half.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS092|and put the other piece in between the two and make a sandwich.
PS08Y|Golly yes.
PS092|so you'd got a piece that shape half new one.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|and that was all welded together in the fire into a straight bar.
PS093|And then you'd start all over again.
PS092|and then you'd start all over again.
PS08Y|Oh I see You didn't use.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|that as a shoe you then.
PS093|Re.
PS08Y|made it an a new.
PS093|Re-shape it.
PS08Y|piece of metal.
PS092|Yes And then.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|yeah and then re re-used it to shoe.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS092|Made another shoe out of a.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS092|er.
PS08Y|yes.
PS093|And that was a genuine economy then.
PS092|Oh yeah Yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Yes Yes.
PS092|Er.
PS093|Erm.
PS092|old cart tyres we used to split them up the middle and made shoes.
PS08Y|Did you.
PS092|Oh yes Er.
PS08Y|Because they were made of the right kind of iron.
PS092|Yeah Er.
PS093|And erm.
PS092|you see we used to when old shoes do you see you could only use them a certain number of times by welding them up.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|er after they got so you hadn't got no more life in them we used to weld short bits onto.
PS08Y|Really.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Still all done in the fire.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Wired.
PS092|Old chains.
PS093|And.
PS092|when they wore thin on the end and we had to put a new link in we never threw the two halves of the link away we pointed them and made them into staples.
PS08Y|Really.
PS092|Because the middle part of the link wasn't worn you see that was still a good bit of metal in it.
PS08Y|Yes course.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Isn't it tragic to think how far from that we've moved.
PS093|Yes it is really.
PS092|Yeah mm.
PS093|Yes it's.
PS08Y|And it's so wasteful u.
PS093|it's all throw away.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|now isn't it.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|It seems morally wrong.
PS08Y|It hurts us.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|who've known.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|the other thing doesn't it.
PS093|Yes it does.
PS092|Yeah yeah.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS093|It goes against the grain terribly.
PS092|And I am if at five minutes to five or five minutes to leaving off time whatever it was and you wouldn't say well we'll get ready to go home you had to pick a half a link up make it into a staple and throw it in the box.
PS08Y|Yes That was ready for next time and you've saved.
PS092|That was ready for when Yeah.
PS08Y|that time.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|I forget what it was you used to make old horse rasps into because for.
PS092|Ooh yes.
PS093|farrier has a has a file with very very coarse teeth on one side.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS093|and slightly less coarse on the other.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|is used for rasping the the hoof erm I can't remember what you used.
PS092|We used to use all sorts of things.
PS093|used the old ones for.
PS092|Hooks flashers.
PS093|Because that's a special hard steel isn't it.
PS092|It's hard steel now.
PS093|It's not ordinary iron is it.
PS092|They used to use make them into flashers and hooks for hedge cutting and.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|hoes for chopping out sugar.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|beet.
PS08Y|Yes because of course you had all the equipment to shape it up anew.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|didn't you.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|You could make whatever sort of shape you wanted from it I should.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|imagine.
PS092|Yep.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|That's an i i interesting thing talking about the names of the tools too erm flashers and hooks now in other parts.
PS092|Now you never hear that.
PS093|of the country you would probably hear them called a slasher and a what.
PS092|I mean nearly all people think a hook is a hook don't do for hanging.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|things on.
PS093|Mm Yes.
PS092|Well in Suffolk you see a hook is a thing for cutting the hedge.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|A hooker.
PS08Y|a a curved scy a sickle type.
PS092|A yeah.
PS08Y|shaped thing.
PS092|Yes.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Or a chopper.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|I see And you just call that a hook.
PS092|A hook yeah.
PS08Y|So you di did you call the thing you were doing hooking or not.
PS092|What er.
PS08Y|Wi with hook would you say.
PS093|When you were using it.
PS08Y|that you were hooking.
PS092|No you'd be.
PS08Y|the hedge or not.
PS092|You'd be hedging.
PS08Y|You're hedging.
PS092|Yeah hedging them.
PS08Y|Yes I see.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|The tool was a separate name.
PS092|Yeah Yeah.
PS08Y|Really Aha.
PS092|Yeah Yeah.
PS08Y|And did you have to repair things well you probably did er farm instruments I don't mean the big implements but things like their scythes and what.
PS092|Oh yes.
PS08Y|have you.
PS092|We used to ma we used to buy the scythe blade and.
PS093|Well that was the blacksmith's bread and butter that kind of thing.
PS092|and do all the other iron work on it you see yes.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Oh yes.
PS08Y|Mhm.
PS092|Yeah Hoes and things like that were all er hand made.
PS08Y|Ha.
PS092|Spuds dock spuds thistle spuds.
PS093|Have you come across a spud.
PS08Y|Now how do you spell that S P A D.
PS093|It would be G D.
PS08Y|G E.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|I think it would be S P U D.
PS092|D yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Oh just a s.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Spud.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Sped Spud.
PS093|I think so I think so.
PS08Y|Really.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Th it's a dialect word really.
PS08Y|Oh not erm not a spadge Yo er.
PS092|No.
PS08Y|I heard the name spadge when I was.
PS093|No it would be spud wouldn't it.
PS092|No spud.
PS08Y|Really.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|It's probably in the dialect book I haven't looked it up.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Yeah.
PS08Y|I'm rather.
PS093|And another good old word is the crome now er that was one I came across for the first time when I came into Suffolk the crome I jolly soon learnt what a crome was I didn't ask I waited to find out.
PS08Y|learn a foreign language.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|isn't it.
PS093|Yes Yes.
PS08Y|What what was that.
PS092|Well a a.
PS093|Mm mm.
PS092|crome is a.
PS093|He couldn't believe I didn't know what a crome was.
PS092|that's ooh ah.
PS092|well either two or four times er turned down on a long handle for pouring things er out of the I mean like when I used to.
PS093|I know what it is now.
PS092|when they used to put er the muck on the fields they used to put so many loads of eight and so many heaps of the well when they pulled it out of the room they'd pulls out the crome.
PS093|Like a fork bent at right angles.
PS092|Angles.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS093|It's the ideal thing for that.
PS093|job.
PS092|Yes.
PS093|you see.
PS092|Yes.
PS093|A fork only bent over.
PS08Y|I see.
PS093|Mhm.
PS092|And the old.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|the real old gardeners and I mean well every house had one because they used to grow their own vegetables didn't they.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS092|Well when they dug the garden after they'd dug it they always cromed it down with a crome before they planted anything.
PS08Y|Really.
PS092|Used the crome as the rake.
PS093|Aha.
PS08Y|Now could that be.
PS093|Mm mm.
PS08Y|the same sort of thing that Noel bought last year when he saw one of the men in the village using it to pull out a lot of weed from undergrowth really.
PS092|I expect so.
PS093|I expect so.
PS08Y|it's er i and it's got three prongs like that and there's I think an arrowhead shape on each prong.
PS092|Ah that'd be the modern ones.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Yes that would be.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|the modern.
PS092|The modern one but er.
PS08Y|adaptation.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|That'd be the modern one.
PS093|Similar principle.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Sim sim.
PS093|Mhm.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|It is.
PS093|Yeah.
PS08Y|erm for getting up a lot.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|of weed.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|The old style crome would be a thing about as wide as that.
PS092|Yeah about ten.
PS08Y|What about.
PS092|ten inches wi and the.
PS08Y|Mhm.
PS092|would be.
PS093|Yes and and the would be parallel.
PS092|Parallel.
PS093|four times wouldn't they.
PS092|Four.
PS093|And e equally distanced.
PS092|Fo for that work.
PS08Y|Ah yes.
PS093|Mhm.
PS092|But for pulling the muck out of the tumble they only have two.
PS08Y|Oh.
PS092|Two tines.
PS08Y|Did they.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|More like a pitch fork bent at right angles then.
PS092|But bent at right angles.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|That would be a muck crome.
PS092|That'd be a muck.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|crome Yeah.
PS08Y|And was a lot of straw in with that.
PS092|Oh that was all straw do you.
PS08Y|Ah.
PS092|see.
PS08Y|Because otherwise you couldn't have pulled.
PS092|No.
PS08Y|er sort of muck without.
PS092|No no.
PS093|No.
PS08Y|straw could you.
PS092|No no.
PS093|No.
PS08Y|But straw.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|of course.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Mhm.
PS092|Yeah And the tines on a muck crome are flat whereas the ones on an ordinary one for all the work were either round or square.
PS08Y|I see.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|So I came across these things you see when we were first married because I used to write out all Hector's bills for him by hand before we had a typewriter.
PS08Y|Mhm.
PS093|and of I'd come across these words you see I'd think crome Crome what is that You know.
PS08Y|Yes Even to spell it.
PS092|And gradually the.
PS08Y|in the first place.
PS093|Yeah.
PS08Y|you needed.
PS093|So I had to.
PS08Y|to know.
PS093|yeah so I did have to guess a great deal.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS093|because no good looking in the dictionary for a lot of these things.
PS08Y|No.
PS093|No no no.
PS092|Mm.
PS093|no.
PS08Y|no.
PS093|No I assumed that a crome was C R O M E and I still do.
PS092|Yes.
PS093|cos I've never come across anything else.
PS092|Well I mean all the all the all the dialect words are.
PS093|Phonetic really.
PS092|spelt.
PS093|aren't they They have to be.
PS092|They're spelt as you say them.
PS093|They have to be.
PS08Y|They are that's true.
PS093|Mm mm They are phonetic.
PS092|They're spelt how you say them so they can be spelt er ten different ways in the same village.
PS093|And still be right.
PS08Y|That's right I see.
PS093|Because there's no there's no dictionary spelling.
PS092|Cos I mean I'd.
PS093|for a lot of them.
PS092|well I I spells how I say it.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Er somebody up the road er hundred yards would spells how he.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|say it.
PS093|I I used to notice that.
PS092|And there's just that little bit of.
PS08Y|It was phonetic spelling.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah Yeah.
PS093|When the cards were from the er the workshop would come in which the lads had done their work I mean one of them I know dear old Pete in particular he'd write for crome C R double O M because that's how he'd say it.
PS08Y|Croom.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah croom.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|But it's still right Yes.
PS08Y|And very often the O in the Suffolk dialect goes to an ooh doesn't it.
PS093|Ooh yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Mhm.
PS08Y|Home.
PS093|Eith either a long ooh or a sort ooh like er like in.
PS092|It's as a.
PS093|room or.
PS092|mostly a short one because.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS092|that's a lazy language the Suffolk dialect in n it.
PS093|I suppose it is in a way.
PS08Y|I suppose a lot.
PS092|You cu.
PS08Y|of dialect is.
PS092|cut out this.
PS093|Yes it is isn't it.
PS092|cut everything short don't you.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|Oh yeah.
PS08Y|Yes you do.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|But it's quite different from the unpleasantly lazy speech that you get now for instance Lancashire i it's.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|not true Lancashire that's spoken up there it's a lazy you.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|know up the city.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|yes yes yes.
PS08Y|that sort of thing Nothing like over.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|No.
PS08Y|here.
PS092|No.
PS08Y|dialect.
PS093|Yeah same as the erm what you get from the outskirts of London the home counties I call.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|that ugly too.
PS08Y|It is.
PS093|True cockney is a treat to listen to.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS093|But there's a lot of adulterated cockney in the home counties I used to hear it a lot in Hertfordshire.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Erm especially in the war because the evacuees of course would come along and of course.
PS092|Yes.
PS093|all the local children picked it up of course they did And we'd all go home talking like them and our mothers complained.
PS093|Er but it was interesting all the same It was interesting to hear them.
PS08Y|Indeed.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|But that a thousand do you see a the dialects are going.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|and they'll soon be gone and one thing which annoyed me er a Scotsman or a Welshman or an Irishman can go on television they'll accept them and they can talk their.
PS093|You mean as a newsreader or a a presenter of programme.
PS092|lingo as a newsreader as a presenter.
PS093|don't you.
PS08Y|Exactly.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|and yet if anybody go on there with a southern dialect they wouldn't well they wouldn't have them there.
PS08Y|That's true isn't it.
PS092|Cos they aren't talking the queen's English.
PS093|It's taking a.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|long time for dialects to be accepted but I think I think that boundary is giving way.
PS08Y|Well I hope.
PS093|frankly.
PS08Y|it will universally because.
PS093|Mm mm.
PS08Y|I feel the Scots make a tremendous fuss about their.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|speech and.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|their traditions.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|You never hear on the whole the Englishman saying but I'm English.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|No.
PS093|No you don't We're.
PS08Y|Do you.
PS093|We're too.
PS092|No no.
PS093|self-effacing aren't we.
PS092|And yet they'll a.
PS08Y|But they.
PS092|they'll accept the big proposals.
PS093|Mm.
PS092|of television and radio.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|and that.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|That's right.
PS092|Top jobs for them.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|But when you te.
PS092|And yet if you go for a top job in the city or anywhere an and start talking in the southern dialect they'll you.
PS093|Yeah you're you're made a laugh of aren't you.
PS08Y|Absolutely.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|That's very true.
PS093|It is extraordinary.
PS08Y|It's also true that up in.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|Scotland they don't like to hear English accents on their television and news.
PS093|Well I never.
PS08Y|They much prefer to have their own people.
PS093|Ooh.
PS08Y|But how often do we listen to a Scottish accent.
PS092|Scot yeah.
PS08Y|And every time a trade unionist comes on.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|I'm afraid.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|we've got a little phrase another.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|bloody Scot we say.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yeah yeah well you do.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|And then you've got them.
PS093|You do.
PS08Y|with the roughest of the.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|the trade.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|unionists.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|pretty well Scot.
PS092|Yeah that's always.
PS093|They are They are.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes Yes.
PS08Y|So we've been perhaps a little.
PS093|Mhm.
PS08Y|bit erm reticent.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|about our dialects.
PS092|Yes.
PS093|Er Yes yes I I.
PS092|But er.
PS093|think it's time they.
PS092|But I'm not gon na change if anybody don't but if they can't accept me.
PS093|No I don't really think so.
PS092|well they must er.
PS08Y|Well er you can't say that it's hard to understand because I'm a Londoner and.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|for a long time I have been.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|and you never say anything that I don't understand unless you were to use a word like crome.
PS093|Well quite.
PS092|Oh yeah.
PS093|a word an.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|actual word.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|that you've never come across.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS093|But after all once is enough and once you know you know don't you.
PS08Y|Exactly.
PS093|You don't forget.
PS08Y|No.
PS092|No.
PS093|Erm.
PS08Y|You don't.
PS093|No No I.
PS092|That's right.
PS093|I found coming into Suffolk from Hertfordshire I hadn't heard the any East Anglian dialect before at all erm I didn't find it difficult there were only two cases and I can remember thinking there were two people er one of whom is still alive er who I had great difficulty in understanding and I thought when I can follow both of them without any difficulty I shall know I really belong.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|And it didn't take long with one of them that was Dennis.
PS092|Mm Dennis.
PS093|and the other one I don't know whether you knew him I think he lived in Earlsome for a time didn't he.
PS092|No well Monksome.
PS093|Didn't he Monksome.
PS092|Monksome.
PS093|Erm a chap called Ben erm.
PS092|No I don't.
PS08Y|No.
PS092|I expect he was days before.
PS093|and my word he was difficult to follow.
PS08Y|Was he.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes Er he spoke fast that was the problem most.
PS08Y|Oh yes.
PS093|Suffolk people don't.
PS08Y|No they don't.
PS093|They give you time to listen and time to think.
PS08Y|They do.
PS093|but he spoke quickly with a very strong accent and that.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|took me a lot of years before I could and I was so pleased when once I was able to say to you I've Ben had been in the shop and we'd had a chat hadn't we.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|You and me and him and Joe was another.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|one and we'd had a chat for a long long time and I said to him afterwards I was able to understand everything he said.
PS08Y|Wonderful.
PS093|I was so pleased.
PS08Y|That's an achievement.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|You know one thing that's striking me at this moment actually when you talk about when you came into Suffolk and you.
PS093|Mm mm.
PS08Y|met er Hector and you told me once before you had no eyes for anyone else there.
PS093|That's right Perfectly true.
PS08Y|Erm in these days when er so large a proportion of marriages breaks down.
PS093|Mm.
PS08Y|erm it seems to me that the marriage that has an interest to your occupation let's say in the man's hands.
PS093|Mhm.
PS08Y|if you like.
PS093|Mhm.
PS08Y|er although you've got your own artistic contribution which you also combine with.
PS093|True yes.
PS08Y|Hector's work.
PS093|That has been a great.
PS08Y|erm.
PS093|strength to us.
PS08Y|Oh I think that's a a tremendous.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|strength to a marriage.
PS093|Yes Yes.
PS08Y|I feel the same with Noel.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|if there's something really interesting that you have.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|between the two.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|of you.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|erm you don't give up at the first little hurdle.
PS093|Course you don't.
PS092|No No No.
PS093|It makes an incredible bond doesn't it.
PS08Y|Doesn't it.
PS093|Absolutely.
PS092|Yeah.
PS08Y|I feel that.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Makes it a good recipe for a good marriage.
PS093|Ooh yes.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|It really does.
PS093|And I th I think about a great deal because it's a very strange it's a very strange thing to talk about but when I came to Suffolk I might have told you this before er I had hardly been away from home at all I was only seventeen when I first met him.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS093|and I had a very sheltered life I was an only child I hadn't been around much I hadn't stayed away from home erm and I came to Suffolk to visit a girl penfriend who was working at Brandeston Hall and erm she at that time was expecting to get engaged to a chappy in the village here who was and still is a friend of Hector's and ours and they didn't marry in the finish but she at that time wanted me to come up to Suffolk to see her and to meet this chappy who she thought she was going to marry and erm so it was holiday from the art school where I was and I thought well why not I'll erm I'll venture and and my parents said yes that would be alright and so er so I came along and erm of course it happened that he was in the he was in the forge talking to Hector on the first evening I came and that was how we met.
PS08Y|Mm.
PS093|And erm i it was an extraordinary thing But added to that I can well remember staying at Kettleborough Chequers erm and er walking along from Kettleborough to Brandeston erm th the very next morning after I'd come here and I think it was before I think it was quite likely before we had we had actually met I don't know whether it was the first day or the second.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|that we met in in the shop there.
PS093|but the strong impression I had is walking over the hill from Kettleborough where the gun club now is walking down into this valley and seeing that view of this little end of the village nestling in the hollow and I can remember feeling a extraordinarily strong sensation that I could easily live there.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|I could belong there.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|and I had never felt it anywhere else and I've never felt it since.
PS08Y|Isn't that wonderful.
PS093|But it there was something that felt right.
PS08Y|I yes I really believe in that.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|feeling A sense of belonging.
PS093|Most extraordinary.
PS08Y|I belong here.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Because I hadn't been around much I hadn't been away from home.
PS08Y|Really.
PS093|and i it was quite forcible.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|And er.
PS08Y|Marvellous.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|I think if one's receptive to things like that.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|you know it si it.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|it strikes you.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|doesn't it.
PS093|Yes.
PS092|Mm.
PS093|It does.
PS08Y|And er.
PS093|There was a rightness about it.
PS08Y|And you don't forget it because.
PS093|No.
PS08Y|you're young enough to be so impressed by it.
PS093|Mhm Yes.
PS08Y|Yes That's wonderful.
PS093|Yes there was a rightness about it.
PS08Y|Right.
PS093|Okay.
PS092|Ha.
PS093|Erm and er I've felt that same sense of rightness at many times over these years this is now our thirty seventh year.
PS092|Thirty seven yeah I.
PS093|Nineteen.
PS092|think so.
PS093|No thirty eight.
PS092|Thirty eight.
PS093|This is nineteen ninety two.
PS092|Yeah.
PS093|This'll be our thirty eighth year in December So it's several Erm there have been times doing work which we have er worked on together different jobs when I have thought yes this is what I'm here for.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Very very strongly.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|And never never more so than of course working on the sword stand.
PS08Y|Yes.
PS093|Never more so than that.
PS08Y|That was wonderful.
PS093|I thought.
PS08Y|wasn't it.
PS093|I the work I'd done in the past the training I've had the experience I've had with Hector and his work that was all leading up to that.
PS08Y|All coming to it.
PS093|It all came together.
PS08Y|Yes I can quite see that really.
PS093|It all came together.
PS08Y|Because.
PS093|Yes.
PS08Y|that was a whole thing wasn't it.
PS093|It was the culmination.
PS08Y|Connection with the.
PS093|Yes.
