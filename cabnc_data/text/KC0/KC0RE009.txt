PS08Y|Belinda if we can start with you more or less erm I heard the other day that you're half thinking that you might like to be a nurse.
PS090|Yeah that's it That's right Mhm.
PS08Y|Can you speak up a bit.
KC0PSUN|Speak up a bit Belinda.
PS08Y|What erm what sort of nurse are you thinking about.
PS090|Nursery nurse looking after young children in nurseries and stuff like that Mhm.
PS08Y|I can imagine you doing that.
PS090|Can you.
PS08Y|Aha.
PS090|Mhm.
PS08Y|I can.
PS090|Yes I'm going for work experience I'm going to Saxted Ministry up there hopefully to see what it's like looking after children you know like a nursery and everything So hopefully I can get the job there from that two weeks and then.
PS08Y|That would be wonderful.
PS090|what it's like Yeah.
PS08Y|I didn't.
PS090|Yes.
PS08Y|know there was one at Saxted.
PS090|Yeah it's called Rainbow I think isn't it Yeah.
KC0PSUN|Oh that's right yes.
PS08Y|And is that for children who are living there or just go in for the day.
PS090|Just go in for the day till their parents go to work I think.

PS090|Right Mhm It's all to do with gcse coursework and see how we're getting on during the two weeks and we get experience for us when we leave school and go to work.
PS08Y|That's a good idea.
PS090|Yeah.
PS08Y|You get a feeling for it then.
PS090|Yeah.
PS08Y|I think it's one of the best jobs for a girl that there are don't you.
KC0PSUN|Well I think so I think erm as long as they can go and work with children and then they've got the time when they can leave off and come but it's having the whole time well then they've children all their life haven't they.
