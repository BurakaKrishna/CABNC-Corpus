PS0DN|And then lying on it.
PS0DP|when I lost my weight with slimming we were try I was losing two pounds a week and I weren't starving I was still drinking and it come off and I lost I lost about I think it was about eighteen pounds it was over a stone I s I was still only down to sort of eleven stone but if I get to like ten stone.

KCAPSUN|No well I wasn't I moved to from Nelson and that's when I was big.
PS0DP|And how did you lose all your weight then You just lost it.
KCAPSUN|I went on an egg diet with the girls in work.
PS0DN|Egg diet I thought.
KCAPSUN|Yes.
PS0DN|they were fattening.
KCAPSUN|No it wasn't just eggs though it was erm like salads and there was steak you could have one meal a day right but it was eggs for your breakfast eggs for your dinner your lunch.
PS0DN|Now I love eggs but I thought eggs.
KCAPSUN|and then it was salad.
PS0DN|binded you.
KCAPSUN|They do They do bind you.
PS0DP|But you'd have to take something to make you.
KCAPSUN|but the thing is you can you eat fruit in between see Hayle so you're having you know you your roughage.
PS0DP|Yeah your roughage with that yeah.
PS0DN|Oh I see.
KCAPSUN|As well like in between.
PS0DP|When I went to slimming I used to get.
KCAPSUN|I tell you what I lost a stone and half in two weeks.
PS0DP|I used to have erm.
KCAPSUN|by sticking to that.
PS0DP|I'd get up in the morning I'd have my two pieces of wholemeal bread toasted with a scraping of marmalade on right and my butter cos I like that For my dinner then I'd have er jacket potato with tuna then about fouro'clock I would have an apple and an orange and maybe a Mars Bar cos right And then before eighto'clock then I would make myself a big meal I'd have a a huge salad I'd do tinned potatoes cos they were on this diet tinned potatoes aren't fattening.
PS0DN|Aren't they.
KCAPSUN|No they're not.
PS0DP|No so I'd have tinned potatoes.
PS0DN|I don't like them I don't like.
PS0DP|I'd have tuna fish I'd have ham everything because you can eat as much meat you could sit down and eat cabbage swedes runner beans cauliflower peas every vegetable.
PS0DM|That's what I'm doing for him now But I don't like veg I don't.
PS0DP|and that's not counted in your in your calories you can just eat that it's all free so you can eat as much as you like of that Cos if I was really hungry I used to go upstairs I'd get all the frozen veg out I'd cook a bit of everything.
PS0DN|It's not so bad.
PS0DP|I'd slam a pork chop under the grill and I'd just eat that And it used to fill me up and I'd.
KCAPSUN|Yeah.
PS0DP|that's nothing then I could eat as much as that as I liked And bacon's not fattening grilled on this diet you can eat as much bacon as you like as long as you cut the fat off and grill it.
PS0DM|That's on this Slimming World diet is it.
PS0DP|It's marvellous yeah I lost weight on it.
PS0DM|What we'll have to do Hayley right when she starts now she'll have to tell us what she's eating every day.
