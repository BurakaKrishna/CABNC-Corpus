PS0A8|but obviously I I'd like somebody else's opinion really.
PS0AE|Yes yes.
PS0A8|and I'm seeing the surgeon today and erm and I met somebody the other day who'd had it done and his fingers weren't affected you know so I mean it's just the luck of the draw I think However I thought well I'm I'm er.
PS0AE|Mind you it does look better than when I saw it last.
PS0A8|Oh yes it is.
PS0AE|Isn't it.
PS0A8|Oh it is it is oh it is.
PS0AE|Yeah it's improving yeah.
PS0A8|it's not er although the the inflammation it was not good at the weekend.
PS0AE|Oh Perhaps you're doing too much Fred and not resting it.
PS0A8|Say again.
PS0AE|You're doing too much you're not resting it.
PS0A8|Well no I'm not I mean this is it erm you don't know er how much to do.
PS0AE|No.
PS0A8|and how much not to do really Oh.
PS0AE|Oh right hope the surgeon might be able to provide you with.
PS0A8|Mm well I I mean really I want him to tell me I mean she implies that I'm gon na get you know back fully back to normal but I I'm beginning to wonder myself.
PS0AE|Mm.
PS0A8|er I I mean I really can't doubt her but erm you know you how you have hunches.
PS0AE|Yeah.
PS0A8|I feel as though I'm on a plateau at the moment although sh sh when I said that she said well i it is getting better so the.
PS0AE|There's a physio Trish I've got a patient for you Trish if you've got five minutes to spare please.
PS0AF|Oh dear.
PS0A8|Er he's ever such a nice patient though.
PS0AE|It's not serious.
PS0AF|Oh great.
PS0A8|he's ever such a nice patient You didn't have the pleasure of meeting him when he used to work here.
PS0AE|This is Fred he used to he used to work in.
PS0A8|Hello contracture.
PS0AF|Is that what you've got.
PS0A8|Opera no I've had it.
PS0AE|He's had an operation.
PS0A8|Mm.
PS0A8|No no I won't say that Operation the sixth of December on the little finger er and my other fingers swelled up.
PS0AF|Mm.
PS0A8|and are still not down Really what I'm wanting you to tell me is how normal is that and.
PS0AF|To be honest I'm not I erm not quite sure really I mean have have you been back to to to clinic following.
PS0A8|Oh yeah yeah yeah Well I had it done on the insurance you know.
PS0AF|Right yeah.
PS0A8|so I'm seeing the surgeon again today.
PS0AF|Are you You.
PS0A8|but of course he's the one who's done it.
PS0AF|Mm.
PS0A8|so even if he sort of made a a bodge I'm not suggesting he has he's not likely to to say yes that's because of that.
PS0AF|So is the finger better then I mean.
PS0A8|Well erm it oh well I mean it is better in as much as it was sticking out like that.
PS0AF|Mm.
PS0A8|and I can whereas I couldn't get a glove on now I can now.
PS0AF|Right.
PS0A8|I haven't got all that much movement.
PS0AF|Yeah.
PS0A8|Well you know I mean it's not too bad I suppose.
PS0AF|No I'd just be I mean I must admit I've I've not really seen one for years and years and years You get quite sort of specialized I think.
PS0A8|Yeah quite.
PS0AF|undoubtedly I think you need to ask him you know that erm just say to him that you're very concerned about the fingers.
PS0A8|Yeah yeah.
PS0AF|and you know what can what can do about it.
PS0A8|Now the physio I'm I'm having the I'm having physio.
PS0AF|Yeah.
PS0A8|and I was just saying to Yvonne er I'm rapidly running out of my physio allowance you know because of the amount that.
PS0AF|Yes yeah yeah perhaps you're not.
PS0A8|she's doing erm and she seems to imply that er it will get back to normal but you know I I just I'm not er happy about that myself.
PS0AF|Well I would have thought so but really erm I think you just need to sort of.
PS0A8|I I I mean it really has been swollen and er inflamed.
PS0AF|So it's down a bit.
PS0A8|Oh yes.
PS0AF|Yeah.
PS0A8|Oh yes yes yes yes Oh yes and I had er pressure sores you know.
PS0AF|Mm Yeah no I think you just need to be frank with him and you know say you're happy about the finger fine but just you know.
PS0A8|I'm more concerned about these.
PS0AF|Yeah.
PS0A8|because these were okay.
PS0AF|Right.
PS0A8|than than this.
PS0AF|Yeah well no I would be direct with him and say you know.
PS0A8|Yeah.
PS0AF|you're really worried about these.
PS0A8|Yeah.
PS0AF|and and just see sort of see what what he says really.
PS0A8|Mm.
PS0AF|and if you're having physio that's that's good but like you say.
PS0A8|No I mean I I don't know how much It the bill was hundred and thirty eight quid last month and it'll be more than that this month and I think my yearly allowance is about three hundred you know so I'm rapidly running out Anyway thanks for your no no.
PS0AF|Sorry I can't really sort of say I must admit I couldn't really see why they should be like that really cos I mean it is a bit puzzling cos if they've only just done anything they've only been tampering with this finger so.
PS0A8|The the the the other thing er I I have the feeling in this finger of not pins and needles but just a slight difference he's obviously cut some nerves I should imagine But er you know I'm as I say I'm more concerned about those.
PS0AF|How annoying But I must admit I haven't seen an I haven't seen you know it's years well it'll be years.
PS0A8|You see what what I'm up against is I mean the physio who who I mean she's private of course.
PS0AF|Mm.
PS0A8|she is one wanting er referrals from Mr so she's not going to say oh well you know there's something wrong there you know.
PS0AF|Mm.
PS0A8|Is she.
PS0AF|No.
PS0A8|You see Er er and er I'm not saying that there is necessarily but even if there was she's not going to because she wants to preserve her her referrals Don't want me.
PS0AF|Well I'd just say you're really worried about these fingers.
PS0A8|Yeah.
PS0AF|and that you know and you just say you know you know what what are you gon na do about this.
PS0A8|Yeah.
PS0AF|you know should it should it actually be like.
PS0A8|Yeah.
PS0AF|Then if you get some answers then you can always say to him well this is what you know this is what.
PS0A8|Yeah well I mean I saw him what either a fortnight or three weeks ago three probably about three weeks and at that stage my plaster that I'd had on after the er op had only been off perhaps a fortnight it was Christmas intervening you see so he had every sort of right to say you know oh well yeah it should be okay yeah.
PS0AF|Think the only thing you can do is as I say be honest and say that you know you're very worried about your fingers.
PS0A8|Yeah yeah.
PS0AF|I know it's not a lot of help but erm.
PS0A8|No well you you.
PS0AF|I'm but I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to say whether it was or not so.
PS0A8|Yeah yeah well that that's fine that's all I wanted to know I'm pleased you popped in i it.
PS0AF|Sorry.
PS0A8|yes but i it's sort of erm.
PS0AF|Even if it's only to give you the confidence you know.
PS0A8|Yeah.
PS0AF|to sort of.
PS0A8|Yeah.
PS0AF|It's awful I I'm the same if I'm going to see a doctor I think ooh.
PS0A8|Well when you've got.
PS0AF|you forget what you were going to ask.
PS0A8|Yes but when you've been when you've been in the work as I have over many years with doctors I was a mental welfare officer so I mean I know er you know you can be fobbed off.
PS0AF|That's right No go for it.
PS0A8|Right.
PS0AF|Well I hope it is but they're not good are they.
PS0A8|Well if that th.
PS0A8|Yes I'm yeah yeah I mean I can drive.
