PS0AD|Hadn't even read the book either but I've fiddled with Natasha's.
PS0AB|I just fiddled with the controls till.
PS0A8|The thing that you you have to remember which you tend not to at the beginning is that Ceefax is B B C for instance so on one and two now if you change channel if you're on teletext and you want to go onto Oracle which is on three.
PS0AB|Three.
PS0A8|you've got to go back to T V.
PS0AB|To change.
PS0A8|to get to three and then back on to teletext.
PS0AB|Oh.
PS0A8|you can't go direct And that's er something that you tend to forget er initially even I mean I still sometimes still do.
PS0AC|Mm.
PS0AB|I was reading my instructions though and it said before you start pressing knobs.
PS0AD|Mm.
PS0AC|Please read the instructions.
PS0AB|read it because you can do a lot of damage pressing the wrong things.
PS0AD|Mm.
PS0AC|Mm And did it also say in big capital letters please do not y let your granddaughter fiddle around with it.
PS0AB|No.
PS0AC|Oh.
PS0AB|But on on my other remote control if I wanted to alter the sound or the colour that was on the erm remote control and it's just a little.
