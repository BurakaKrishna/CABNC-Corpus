PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V5|Do you like the look of that with book shelves down the side there.
PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V5|Yeah you've got three doors which is more storage space than the other one cos the other one only had a cupboard down had no drawers what's the matter.
PS0V4|Doesn't like it you prefer the other one.
PS0V6|Yeah I do.
PS0V5|It's just that you your better of space if you have that one and you can books down there or on them whatever you want too and if you had that one you'd be able to have a erm another cupboard as well probably Is it cheaper.
PS0V4|Well.
PS0V5|It's only cheaper because it's in a sale it's been reduced down from forty pounds it was forty pounds before.
PS0V4|No if if she didn't like it then we.
PS0V5|Well you can go and have a look if you like.
PS0V4|A.
PS0V5|If you don't like it it's up to you.
PS0V6|No I'm.
PS0V4|What's up.
PS0V6|Nothing.
PS0V5|What's up there is we can tell what's the matter Tell us.
PS0V6|I like that one and now you've put me in a difficult position cos I like that one have that one but I like the lockable cupboard on the other one.
PS0V4|Lockable cupboard there isn't a lockable cupboard.
PS0V5|Yes there is.
PS0V6|Yes there is.
PS0V4|Is there.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V5|Yeah but the other one remember it was a choice of two wasn't it.
PS0V4|I thought we were getting her the one with the drawers one with a lockable cupboard is.
PS0V5|Well is a bigger one.
PS0V4|is a bigger one.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|I thought we were getting her the one but the only thing is the other has got drawers both sides hasn't it if I remember rightly.
PS0V5|Just one side I tell you what let's take you don't do that or you'll break it off let's take you and you can have a look at this one Why do you want a lockable cupboard we don't well it's very so why do you need a lockable cupboard.
PS0V6|Cos I just need one I just like it.
PS0V5|Well I don't think that one will fit in your bedroom in any case having looked at the size of the wardrobes and the site of the gap that you've got.
PS0V4|No it was the other one with the t with the drawers that that would er.
PS0V5|That we thought was best.
PS0V4|Smaller one.
PS0V5|Well let's have a think we'll we'll have a think and then have a look if we go up there it's a huge furniture place they won't have just one they'll have more than one ok How about that.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|I said they won't just have one designer desk will they.
PS0V4|No we'll have a look around and see what they've got.
PS0V5|If they just furniture ok whereas Argos do a lot of other things as well so if we take you over there you can have a look see if there's anything you really fancy I know it's awful making you actually have to decide for yourself.
PS0V6|I I I like the one with the lockable cupboard door but I like that one as well.
PS0V5|I don't think that one will fit in Yes.
PS0V6|If they took out one of these drawers and have a lockable cupboard I'd have it no questions.
PS0V5|Yeah well let's go and have a look ok.
