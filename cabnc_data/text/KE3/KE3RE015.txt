PS0V4|Can you change your game so you can play it with thr with two.
PS0V6|No what you do.
PS0V4|Mm mm.
PS0V6|is erm well you do it you've got one Joker in pack right and you mix them up and you deal them out and you look at your cards if you've got a Joker.
PS0V4|Mm Yeah Yeah.
PS0V6|then then you everyone's got to mix up there cards again.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V6|You've got to put them in the order so you can see him but the other person can't.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V6|and you've got to pick someone to choose out your card and they don't know if you've got the Joker or not.
PS0V4|Mm mm.
PS0V6|and they've got to pick one of the cards and they might get the Joker.
PS0V4|Right I see.
PS0V6|But the trouble is you can tell who's got the Joker when there's two because if you haven't you know the other person has.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V6|But if you've got more than one person then it's harder.
PS0V4|Mm we could play pairs if you like.
