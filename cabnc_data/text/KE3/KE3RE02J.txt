PS0V8|They don't yeah They talk start talking what they think.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V8|is properly.
PS0V4|The note says sort of don't tell people until after or unless they ask you.
PS0V5|Or unless they ask.
PS0V4|they ask you directly what they're doing and erm.
PS0V8|No wonder our Tone went to sit down which he don't usually do.
PS0V4|as you're being my mum you didn't keep us very long.
PS0V4|It was er and when she got worked up about that Fancy Goods place.
PS0V8|It was really.
PS0V5|It sounds ever so good though.
PS0V4|It's it's really coming out.
PS0V5|Surprising though cause normally a place like that can need a car.
PS0V8|Car.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|The thing is I suppose they rely on word of mouth.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V8|They must do.
PS0V4|Well they don't they keep there prices down because they didn't spend a lot on advertising.
PS0V5|That's right.
PS0V8|How's Windy.
PS0V6|All right.
PS0V8|Are you still still with us.
PS0V4|Still captive is he.
PS0V8|Oh dear.
PS0V8|Seems so funny having a Houdini dog Seems so funny having a tall dog after having short dogs.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V8|And he's all he's all legs.
PS0V5|Oh Oh they're beautiful.
PS0V4|Hm.
PS0V5|It's odd though you get used to them.
PS0V8|Yeah He really is all legs.
PS0V4|Oh.
PS0V8|He's got such a tiny little tummy.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|Hm mm.
PS0V8|Big chested where their lungs are for running.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V8|And nothing but miles of legs.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|Oh.
PS0V8|I must admit a whippet was the dog that I originally wanted.
PS0V5|Yeah Very timid.
PS0V8|It's just Yeah.
PS0V4|Hm.
PS0V8|The trouble is if you're.
PS0V5|Oh he'll come out.
PS0V8|if you're the only one in house he follows you and you're looking for him and every time you're moving around he's moving around behind you so you can't find him I thought I wonder where the hell's he gone I mean he was he was immediately behind me.
PS0V4|Oh ho ho ho.
PS0V5|Oh.
PS0V8|He just goes around and I can't find him.
PS0V6|You need to take your hand off him and put it round you.
PS0V8|Yeah He he he keeps really close up to you when he's following you.
PS0V4|Hm.
PS0V5|Oh.
PS0V4|Oh.
PS0V5|Oh I reckon they lovely I really do whippets.
PS0V8|He's got a lovely little face on him.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V8|Cause I'm I'm so used to small dogs It seems funny to me.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V8|I you we I got used to Wendy's And you I mean people say whippets are not cuddly but they're just as cuddly you know you get used to picking them up.
PS0V5|Picking them up and you get they put one paw on the settee like and I said no Windy and he went.
PS0V4|Oh.
PS0V8|Oh.
PS0V8|Of course when he gets over the timidness he'll probably get up to more mischief.
PS0V5|I'll tell you what if he's six months old you'll have to watch him chewing as well.
PS0V8|Yeah yeah.
PS0V5|Because he'll be losing teeth.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V5|And he'll chew I only caught Ben chewing once Ben was eight months old when we had him He was a bit older.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V5|And I thought he's quiet and it was about a week after we had no twice And once we had it was before we had all our carpet done in the hall.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V5|we had a rug at the top of the stairs.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V5|And he was chewing the corner of this rug and it was all soggy and horrible.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V5|And another time he went quiet and he was in the front room and when I went in he was chewing the leg of the settee.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V5|And that's wood.
PS0V5|And there's still the teeth marks on it now.
PS0V8|Oh yeah.
PS0V5|We can't get rid of them.
PS0V8|a lot about that when you went when they went last year.
PS0V5|Oh yeah.
PS0V4|Yeah.

PS0V8|I was worried you wouldn't get the.
PS0V5|Yeah.
