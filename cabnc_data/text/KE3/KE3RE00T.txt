KE3PSUN|No it'll take a while.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|it'll come suddenly What all you need know is a polishing off.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|You know you it's that's what it is it's getting the flow.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|and that takes the one off.
PS0V4|Erm but he sorted something out for me I I said cos of course now.
PS0V5|Carry on drying your hair can you You've got it all.
PS0V4|Yes of course you carry on drying your hair erm so what happens now is that er I'm coming off the er coming off the clutches as before the corner.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|and if it's a tight one and you're going round it in first really tight one then what you need to be doing really is slipping the clutch.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|if it's really tight slipping the clutch in first and what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to control it on the accelerator you can't do it.
PS0V5|You'll be able to but you can't at the moment.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|And that.
PS0V4|And it's much easier to try and control it on the clutch.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|So he s I said to him is it alright says am I in danger of coasting if I've got my foot on the if if I'm taking the corner in first and I'm slipping and I got the clutch I'm using the engine but I've not much.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|and he said oh no that's not coasting.
PS0V5|No.
PS0V4|It's only if you've got the clutch right in.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|But erm in second my foot should be flat on the floor He took me round that blooming Argyle Road three times.
PS0V5|Oh the horrible corner.
PS0V4|Yeah cos I told that was one I said that's that's the one I I over slowed on my test.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|And he's told me that it's first gear right.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|So what I was doing I was coming into it I was coming in too fast for the gear not too fast for the corner but too fast for the gear.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|Shoving it in shoving it into first bring the clutch up quickly and the car goes weer and virtually stops.
PS0V5|Yeah yeah yeah.
PS0V4|so it wasn't the fact I was trying to lose too much speed it was that I changed into first and didn't have.
PS0V5|Enough revs on the engine to keep it going.
PS0V4|enough revs on the engine he'd be going and when I lift raised the clutch whereas if I had brought the clutch up part way.
PS0V5|The car would of slowly slowed down to be at the speed that the engine.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|was going on yeah yeah.
PS0V4|Well as I actually had to going round the corner to get myself round the corner I had to come off the brake and onto the accelerator.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|to actually get myself round the corner.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V5|Yes because you see I don't remember I I think I take that one in second you see.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|But.
PS0V4|I took it I he said well try it and we went round it in first and I went and it went rrah.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|and and so erm we er then I came round and I did it in second he said there you went too wide there.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|you came close to the white line.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|Yes course there's always a car parked on the corner isn't it.
PS0V5|There's always a car parked on the corner.
PS0V5|I must admit I'd always cheat at that corner when I'm coming up to it I don't do it suddenly.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|I'm then coming up to it I move fractionally out into the road.
PS0V4|yeah.
PS0V5|then you've got more room to get round If you sit glued to the pavement it's a hell of a job to get round.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|whereas if your fractionally out further into the road it's easier to got slightly different.
PS0V4|I didn't have that excuse because there's a car parked before the turning.
PS0V5|oh so you've had to get out.
PS0V4|I had to be out wide and then turn in.
PS0V5|yeah.
PS0V4|and there's a car on the opposite side of the road as you turn in aha so you go outside work and then round and ha ha oh.
PS0V5|You'll get it.
PS0V4|But that slipping the clutch is blimey useful.
PS0V5|It is.
PS0V4|I beginning to find how useful cos I can keep the revs going.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|When when I'm not sure what's happening and people are sort of weaving about and things like that you can use that and you can just tick over and your ready to move if you need to and you can stop quite quickly if you need to as well.
PS0V5|Yeah yeah I see.
PS0V4|I mean we've I've there was a situation these are the roads he's taking me around now he had me reverse round the corner which was practically blind couldn't see what was round the corner so I was edging round and it was on a hill so I had to do it every time I stopped I had to put the handbrake on so I didn't roll.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|And edging round the corner checking all ways there was a parked car there's a van parked the opposite side of the road so anything turning in had to come over into my the path of me.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|and a coming out of that there were some cars parked some other cars trying to drive through I was coming out trying to turn right there was another car waiting to turn left and he couldn't come in cos I was coming out.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|So I had to drive out past him pull over to the other side of the road as much as possible to let him come through and the other cars come through then I could come.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|And doing that to have the clutch sort of half way up in first you just sort of you just.
PS0V5|you need help.
PS0V4|sort of kick on and it's quite nice and you've got it all under control and if you get a chance to go you can and if you've got to stop it's no problem.
PS0V5|yeah.
PS0V4|And then I got myself in a knot cos there was a car coming up the road.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|between a lot of parked cars and there was a I was coming down the road and all I needed to do was to actually stop where I was cos there was enough room on his side of the road for him to come past the parked car and round me.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|I sort off parked car there and I came up and he had room to do that.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|and what I did was there was a gap here and I drove into the gap nose first and I did do a hell of a lot of steering to get myself out.
PS0V5|Yeah but that means that they still do occasionally.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|I mean that very very occasionally you'll do something and you'll think erm why didn't I do that you think that's stupid you know.
PS0V5|and you think oh.
PS0V4|yeah There's no need no need to do that he said.
PS0V5|No occasionally I'll do something like that mind you.
PS0V4|There's plenty of room yeah there's plenty of room for him to get passed in.
PS0V5|Yeah I was annoyed up at Christine's school the other day I was waiting for Anita and there's driveways all along that road.
PS0V4|Mm mm.
PS0V5|so there's stops where you can park on those.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|driveways it was pouring down with rain one day so I was going up to meet her and we I'd got up there I've learnt now I leave home at quarter past three if it's raining.
PS0V4|mm.
PS0V5|I go up to meet Anita anyway you can get a parking space up there so I've turned drove up there they say I haven't left as early it was while I was learning.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|when the erm so it a car parked across a drive and a car the car behind him which was in a space was going.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|and it was in quite a big space I could off got in behind him and then changed if I'd reversed in but when I saw this other chap sat in his car and then he indicated he wanted to pull out so I let him go.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|Then I drove into his space well then somebody else came and drove in behind me and the car in front then was sort of oh yeah then somebody else came and reversed in in front of him so the car in front it was across the drive was boxed in by this time I didn't box him in I just.
PS0V4|No.
PS0V5|parked behind but then somebody else came and parked in front of him and he was there and sort you could see him looking you know he looked at the driveway and he looked he was looking in his rear view mirror and then he turned round and looked like this then he looked at the front and he was thinking my god I can't get out of here and all of a sudden a little car comes up the road stops goes beep beep on the horn wan na get in the drive this bloke went ha ha ha ha and he couldn't do anything.
PS0V5|So so he looked he looked round at me he looked at the the other group waiting in front and he was he flashed his lights at them so that they realised what was going on by then they moved forward a bit I moved back a bit and he just had enough room he reversed right up close to me and then got out but he just had enough room to get out and since then I won't park over the driveway up there cos you can bet your life the one driveway along that road and you parked in front is the one that somebody wants to get into.
PS0V4|Ah Yeah.
PS0V5|Oh right I'd better go actually Mother eh be er complaining.
PS0V4|Yeah okay.
PS0V5|Where have you been you said half past three.
PS0V4|Well it's twenty five to four what does that.
PS0V5|It'll be twenty to by the time I get round there.
PS0V4|Better do this washing up hadn't I.
PS0V5|I can't.
PS0V4|I'd put.
PS0V5|believe it when he took the.
PS0V4|I put in for the eh my driving test again.
PS0V5|Oh good.
PS0V4|Okay.
PS0V5|Good good.
PS0V4|Sometime in the New Year now.
PS0V5|What date did you put on the form not before.
PS0V4|Well he's put a month from the last test.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|Well you won't have it around Christmas after between Christmas and the New year.
PS0V5|No no.
PS0V4|It'll be erm January time I suppose.
PS0V5|I I said to him I I don't want I know I can't have a test soon but I don't really want another one that soon.
PS0V4|No but now all that your doing is polishing your drive better off.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|unfortunately that can be a very painful business.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|Depends.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|You might find it easy.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|easier.
PS0V5|What.
PS0V4|But.
PS0V5|we doing tomorrow.
PS0V4|Tomorrow well trainee to wash and a hoover.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|This is yet Tesco's open as well we've lost our.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|little driving spaces now.
PS0V5|Yeah okay.
PS0V4|Masterline's open are open.
PS0V5|Yeah so I can't.
PS0V4|You can have a drive round actually round by the Coca Cola factory there maybe somewhere.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|you can go.
PS0V5|I think I what what I'm thinking is that this sort of are there's er any any driving would be good.
PS0V4|Yes it would.
PS0V5|No matter what I do.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|But checking this slipping the clutch in first.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|Cos when you try if you try and control it on the accelerator it's very it's really jerky.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|or it's very difficult to keep it smooth.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|I won't say it's really jerky but it.
PS0V4|I can do it but I've been driving for two and a half years.
PS0V5|Yeah yeah.
PS0V4|and then it's.
PS0V5|I.
PS0V4|And I can only just do it.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|It's very I mean the foot control is very very.
PS0V5|And it's so much easier to put some reeves on than use the clutch.
PS0V4|It is.
PS0V5|It is.
PS0V4|But then again you've got to feel a bit careful there because it can misconstrued totally.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|if but I mean if your obviously doing it and you more moving the clutch up and down.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|then fair enough.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|You know.
PS0V5|He said something and I couldn't make sense of it.
PS0V4|What did he say.
PS0V5|because he said that when I came into that corner I pulled in I'd slowed too much and then had to drive round drive round the corner with my left foot flat on the floor and I thought oh shouldn't your left foot be flat on the floor when you corner and that's probably what he was getting at as I could off been slipping the clutch.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|But when he said it I thought oh I thought I had to have my left foot flat on the floor when I cornered cos in second you have too.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|In second it's cut and dry.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|You've got to have your foot flat on the floor before you corner.
PS0V4|That corner is an absolute horrible.
PS0V5|Yeah I know.
PS0V4|it does on the corner.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|and that one you've got to drive it definitely than most corners.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|so you you can't treat that as an ordinary left handed turn.
PS0V5|No.
PS0V4|it is very.
PS0V5|But if you can't cope with it.
PS0V4|You've got to be able to cope with it.
PS0V5|You've got to be able to cope with it.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|But you've got to treat it as a special case.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|and you've got to.
PS0V4|No I I won't tell you how I was taught to do it because I was taught to do it very differently.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|I was taught to do it in first and use the accelerator.
PS0V5|Mm.
PS0V4|You know.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|Mm so cos he said it'll help.
PS0V5|Help with your accelerator control.
PS0V4|With your accelerator control yeah.
PS0V5|So it's diff of course there's courses giving.
PS0V4|yeah.
PS0V5|instructors different ways of teaching you.
PS0V4|yeah He said.
PS0V5|You you need fine control on the clutch.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|but you also need it on the accelerator as well.
PS0V4|yeah.
PS0V5|and he said well okay with your reversing and everything else your getting the front control on the clutch.
PS0V4|So yeah.
PS0V5|this will help you to do it on your.
PS0V4|do it on your accelerator.
PS0V5|accelerator.
PS0V4|whereas.
PS0V5|So.
PS0V4|I I finding the control on the accelerator difficult.
PS0V5|yeah.
PS0V4|in first erm and I've got some fine control on the clutch and I can use that to deal with that particular corner.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|Perhaps.
PS0V5|Yes.
PS0V4|That's just what he's saying.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|Any rate.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|See you later then.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|I see you later than oh where's the car keys I had them on the.
PS0V4|There we are I was hiding them with my hand.
PS0V5|Yeah I know do you want a cake or is it not too naughty Christine can you turn that volume down a bit it's up too high Yes you want to take it.
PS0V5|do your hair.
PS0V4|Bye.
PS0V5|Bye.
