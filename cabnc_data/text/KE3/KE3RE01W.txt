PS0V4|I pulled up fairly tight behind a car.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|and then I was trying to come out and I started to pull out into a gap and Brian said oh know don't pull out I said oh okay he said the thing is your fairly tight so your gon na have to come out slowly so you need a bigger gap than otherwise.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|And the gap wasn't really big enough do you know what I mean.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|It would off been o okay if I just been able to pull out and drive down the road.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|because I had to pull out round the stationery vehicle as well I would off taken too long getting out.
