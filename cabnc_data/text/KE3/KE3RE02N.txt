PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|He just went straight for him and you know he just didn't think about where he was going or anything and he.
PS0V8|And when he comes to look round.
PS0V4|He was completely lost.
PS0V4|And as it was I could see him and I called him and he looked over and he saw me and he came dashing across all the gardens He was ever so pleased to see me.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|But he see a cat and choo he's gone.

PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|He said you weren't to let a new dog off the lead until he had for six weeks.

PS0V4|To let it get let it rot Let it get gamey and he's erm Chinese assistant the person who has been assigned to sort of look after him and do his do his translating and things like that took it down and buried it cause they didn't eat rotten meat they did.
PS0V4|Oh you can't beat a wet shave.
PS0V8|I don't like Gillette.
PS0VB|No.
PS0V4|You can't beat a wet shave I find I find I mean people have said that oh having a wet shave makes my face sore and things like that I find that using an electric shaver makes your face sore cause you're rubbing your face all the time Whereas.
PS0V8|But I mean with a blade it's only one.
PS0V4|That's right.
PS0V8|Yeah yeah.
PS0V4|and it's all I mean I use this gel stuff.
PS0V8|Hm.
PS0V4|which doesn't dry the skin dry the skin out or anything and erm it's just like washing your face with water I mean it doesn't I used to hate it when I was doing plays there and you have er grease paint on and you'd be you'd try and you'd have to cream on your face to get the grease grease paint off.
PS0V8|Get it off.
PS0V4|And so you'd be putting lots and lots of grease and much on your skin and then you get spots.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V4|And you'd be trying to shave and you don't want to cut spots.
PS0V8|Err.
PS0V4|Oh Horrible.
PS0V8|And the cream actually brought you out in spots did it That they were putting on or was it the actual make up or.
PS0V4|Well it's just it's not the the grease the make up or the cream it's the fact that you're you're putting so much muck on your skin all the time and it clogs up pores and causes spots Cause you have to put a lot of cream on your face to get the make up off and you do that especially if you're doing two performances a day it's an awful lot mess and much you're putting on your face and you can't get it all off.
PS0V8|Done anything about a Christmas presents yet Jack.
