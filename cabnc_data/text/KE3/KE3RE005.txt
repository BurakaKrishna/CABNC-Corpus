PS0V5|Can I put the radio on.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V4|I think a lot of it was to do with the fact that I'd never driven in the dark before.
PS0V5|Well yeah it's bound to throw you I mean its.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|it's the first time you drove in the dark was on your driving test wasn't it.
PS0V4|Yeah I must admit I think that a little bit erm.
PS0V5|It was unfortunate.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|but it was.
PS0V4|I suppose I could have er looking at.
PS0V5|Was it as dark as this.
PS0V4|By the time I'd finished yes it was pitch dark.
PS0V5|Well the only thing you can do is hopefully your next test isn't at the same time make it a.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|different time.
PS0V4|But in any event it would be a good idea if I had some tests some lessons in the dark.
PS0V5|Might be I mean ask Brian see.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|what he can do because.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|I mean I knew the first day I drove in the dark was the first night we had the car and it was most odd experience.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|I mean first day.
PS0V4|I found it.
PS0V5|driving a brand new car and then.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|driving in the dark for the first time ha.
PS0V4|Yeah I'd find it quite difficult well I could see the headlights coming up and I was thinking now how fast is that car coming up I don't really know.
PS0V5|Yeah and the thing is also being new to driving you tend to look at the headlights rather than look away from them.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|And that doesn't help because I don't know it wasn't I don't think you'd find it was as dark as this.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|Not at fouro' clock its not quite that dark at.
PS0V5|half past yeah.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|but not this dark at four not yet.

PS0V4|Oh.
PS0V5|Nice chap.

PS0V4|either.

PS0V4|it's a bad as you said it's a bad time to start driving now there's an awful lot of.
PS0V5|Idiots come out.
PS0V4|idiots on the road especially coming.
PS0V5|last.
PS0V4|up to Christmas.
PS0V5|Yeah last Christmas was a real eye opener to me cos the Christmas before.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|I didn't drive very much cos my Dad was still so bad I only did.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|the essential journeys.
PS0V4|Mhm.
PS0V5|and I mean I then I'd only just had my operation an and to actually drive for longer than about twenty minute journeys was killing so.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|I only drove over to to do the shopping and to pick Christine up from School.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|That was all.
PS0V4|Yeah you're right I look at the headlights.
PS0V5|Yeah you must do you see you've got to.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|look if you've got to concentrate on anything concentrate on the white line or.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|the kerb certainly the white line if you can.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|cos if you concentrate on the kerb you tend to drive a bit too close to it.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|and also it's not always there for you to see easily.
PS0V4|No.
PS0V5|whereas the white line is But if you look into the headlights it can be not dark erm but it appears to be dark because.
PS0V4|Well your pupils re erm.
PS0V5|they react into the headlights.
PS0V4|react into the headlights yeah so it makes it seem darker.
PS0V5|And you've got ta be careful as well at night not to hang on to the tail lights of the thing in from of you.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|cos it's very easy to do it because they're two little red beacons.
PS0V4|Yes.
PS0V5|you know you've still got to look ahead.
PS0V4|Yes.
PS0V5|and concentrate on what's happening.
PS0V4|Yes.
PS0V5|further up the road.
PS0V4|There was one point during my test when I was driving along and erm the I was creeping forward in a stream of traffic and the person in front of me had crossed the solid white line at some traffic lights and the lights changed and it would have been very easy to follow his lights and just carry on.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|but I didn't I stopped.
PS0V5|But you see it every day I mean.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|You know I've had it happen the lights have changed just as I've been crossing them so I've gone over and three cars immediately behind me have followed me.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|We're gon na have to get a tyre gauge I reckon they've got a new depth of tread one point six millimetres which is bigger than the.
