PS0V8|You can have some branches that curl back down here too.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V8|they don't all have to go up.
PS0V5|No.
PS0V8|They can curl back down here.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V8|Cos they won't all go up on a tree.
PS0V6|A few gaps maybe just a little bit coming out.
PS0V8|Mr Who.

PS0V8|No.
PS0V5|Yeah we just really thoroughly did the car out but that's all we did we didn't go shopping.
PS0V6|You can get a straight twig without anything on it can't you.
PS0V5|Mhm.
PS0V6|Or you can have twigs with bits joining on together can't you They do vary.
PS0V8|They go all different ways twigs.
PS0V6|Yeah they vary.
PS0V8|They'll be like one another ha.
PS0V6|Mm and my art's not too good I'm afraid.
PS0V4|That's not bad.
PS0V8|What's wrong with your art my love Is it complications or what.
PS0V6|Can't draw properly.
PS0V8|The way she said my art's not too good.
PS0V5|my art.
PS0V6|Funny yes really hilarious.
PS0V5|Well it sounded like it Christine.
PS0V8|Oh dear.
PS0V6|that twig joins there.
PS0V8|My art.
PS0V6|No look at it.
PS0V6|I mean that is suppose to be a tree does not resemble a tree at all you'd think it was a carrot.
PS0V4|Let's have a look.
PS0V6|Antlers.
PS0V4|These they don't.
PS0V4|they don't join onto the trunk like that.
PS0V8|No they go up thick in thick ones and then come out from the.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V8|if it was me I'd draw a thick trunk and lots of lines come out from it.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|You don't I mean you don't see a tree with a flat top with all the branches coming out do you.
PS0V6|Mm well I can't think of any other way to draw it though.
PS0V8|They come out it in thick ones and then the thick ones are on the thin ones are on the thick ones.
PS0V5|Have you got an old piece of paper.
PS0V6|I'm terrible let me rub out the entire thing and start all over again yeah.
PS0V8|Yeah it's the best thing I find.
PS0V6|Here I go.
PS0V5|And you branches start off what are you going to do.
PS0V8|And rub out.
PS0V6|All of that.
PS0V8|Yes that's right.
PS0V5|It'll be a mess.
PS0V4|No.
PS0V5|Christine.
PS0V4|No get let start off yep on erm show you.
PS0V6|What I've just rubbed it all out.
PS0V4|on a bit of paper.
PS0V5|Yep I need a separate bit of paper.
PS0V6|Daddy I have in my bag can you get that out A little spotted bag.
PS0V5|I can't find a bit that Give me the pencil and let me show you.
PS0V6|I'll get you'll have to go just go right to the back just at the back otherwise you're gon na be flipping through millions of pages.
PS0V5|Okay Can I do it on there.
PS0V6|Yes yes okay.
PS0V5|Look you start off and you've got your trunk okay.
PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V5|What haven't you got you got two or three perhaps two big ones.
PS0V4|Can you turn that up.
PS0V5|coming off at the trunk see like that.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V5|and you.
PS0V6|Oh I see what you mean now.
PS0V5|another one like that and then what happens is you've got smaller branches lots of smaller branches coming off of piece.
PS0V6|Yeah and then it joins up together doesn't it.
PS0V5|and then you've got smaller branches coming off of the smaller branches.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V5|and it makes twigs.
PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V5|So you've got an this this branch will keep going perhaps until it gets really tiny.
PS0V6|It's incredible cos all the little bits join together I mean what's that.
PS0V4|No they don't they cross over and they tangle up but once a branch starts off it doesn't join on to another one.
PS0V6|I didn't mean that I meant when you look at a tree it's sort of got.
PS0V4|A cris-cross.
PS0V6|yeah sometimes you get a tree like with a little bit coming off the side.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V6|and then it's sort of joined together onto another branch and then there's a branch there.
PS0V4|No I don' know what you mean.
PS0V6|Er it's hard to explain I can't explain that.
PS0V8|As Daddy says once they come out they don't join onto another.
PS0V4|You see that one would sort of.
PS0V6|Mhm.
PS0V4|carry on going and that one would go up behind it.
PS0V5|Look Christine if I draw it.
PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V5|as a diagram rather than as a tree Right you've got one branch.
PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V5|you start off with one branch like that.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V5|now that branch will divide into to two or you'll get one one bit coming off the side you might get another one up here.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V5|right So they're going to go see then you get other branches coming off of that one.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V5|the same and other branches coming off of that one and other branches coming off of that one it's sort of gets smaller and smaller and is gets.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V5|so you you've got perhaps two off of there and then another one off of the side of there and as you go it gets it gets sl slightly smaller each time see what I mean.
PS0V6|Yes and it comes to just to to the.
PS0V5|to the.
PS0V6|light one then you stop don't you.
PS0V5|Yeah that's right see see what I mean.
PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V5|It ge it you just sort of keep going until it stops.
PS0V6|Right I'll clean that up and start again this is brilliant.
PS0V4|Mhm.
PS0V6|Have you seen that.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V6|Mum.
PS0V5|Nun.
PS0V5|She can't find the stereo Oh lovely.
PS0V6|Pulling out one by one oh no ooh.
PS0V5|The worse thing I've ever done is wax for my legs I did it once mhm.
PS0V8|I never did it.
PS0V6|What happened.
PS0V8|Did it work then did it.
PS0V5|Yeah it literally it's like sticking a sticking plaster on your legs and pulling it off.
PS0V8|and tearing it off urgh.
PS0V5|Only it holds onto the hairs so much that it rips them out so that you end up with legs with no hairs on it but ah It's best done very quickly.
PS0V8|My legs have never been hairy.
PS0V5|Mine are the only actually they're not as bad as they used to be they need doing now but Daddy's so they're not too bad.
PS0V8|No some people it if their hair's dark and it don't matter what length.
PS0V5|No.
PS0V8|of time they don't do it.
PS0V5|No mine aren't too bad really it's just that I don't like being having said that I had one.
PS0V6|Mum so there's my basic trunk trunks aren't straight aren't they They never straight.
PS0V5|No.
PS0V6|straight straight are they No not sort of bits sticking out Windy Windy hello darling.
PS0V8|Let her go.
PS0V6|He's beautiful good boy yeah are you a good boy.
PS0V8|Ben go round there can't wedge through.
PS0V6|Hello darling.
PS0V8|oh ar alright then you've got him now.
PS0V8|I'd be in quick Oh.
PS0V6|Windy.
PS0V8|think he's a lovely cushion.
PS0V6|cushion.
PS0V8|ha hey he's got his cushion back Eh Got his cushion back ah oh Windy yeah.
PS0V6|They get them you can do sort of like.
PS0V8|Oh Windy has he got his cushion back Oh dear That trunk divided into two or three different branches.
PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V4|I see.
PS0V6|it's sort of does that.
PS0V5|That's right.
PS0V4|I think you need to make that a bit thicker so it divides into two.
PS0V5|Do you to as well or will he eat.
PS0V6|I don't know what to do there.
PS0V8|I haven't tried to get one.
PS0V4|Yeah but there isn't a flat top it divides sort of in the middle.
PS0V8|I don't know anybody.
PS0V4|Do see what I mean.
PS0V6|No I don't a flat top what you on about I haven't got.
PS0V4|There isn't a flat top it divides sort of.
PS0V6|Eh.
PS0V4|down the middle.
PS0V6|I see.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V6|horrible I got ta rub it out it's no good.
PS0V5|Yeah I suppose eventually you'll have to start giving him one won't you.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V5|Cos otherwise er it's gon na.
PS0V4|No.
PS0V5|lose him.
PS0V6|I'm just rubbing it out a little bit to give me a bit more space.
PS0V4|Mhm.
PS0V6|if you see what I mean right I'll re-draw all that bit in a minute this is all gon na be sort of black.
PS0V4|Right so if you mark in where you want it to split.
PS0V8|I wonder how he'll grow up.
PS0V6|Like that.
PS0V8|You got you you try it.
PS0V5|Ha ha ah.
PS0V4|Down the middle so put the pencil sort of in the middle.
PS0V8|Come and have a cuddle.
PS0V4|and draw the the middle bit first do you see what I mean.
PS0V6|Mm like that.
PS0V4|Yeah and the other side.
PS0V5|Yeah you don't.
PS0V4|That's it.
PS0V5|wan na be grown up do you.
PS0V6|Looks like a waterfall ha then you just do a thicker one don't you.
PS0V4|Then you take that and taper down a bit and then it's gon na split again.
PS0V6|And it can split like that.
PS0V4|Mhm.
PS0V5|Have you got used to the feel of him now.
PS0V6|And then does that go round like that.
PS0V8|I don't know.
PS0V5|Basically they feel just.
PS0V4|Mm you split it down the middle again so that will go off that way and then that branch go that way see.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V8|when Jack comes in from work ha ha.
PS0V6|Then.
PS0V4|And then it splits again and splits again.
PS0V6|I can't split it again look at the size of that line I'm gon na have to oh yeah I see what you mean.
PS0V4|Mhm.
PS0V6|That's for my.
PS0V4|See the branches get smaller and smaller and smaller.
PS0V6|yeah.
PS0V5|That's slightly nice.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V6|I've got we haven't got ta do any leaves it's just an ordinary tree.
PS0V4|Mhm.
PS0V6|of Autumn.
PS0V5|A winter tree.
PS0V6|Yeah and then it goes up again yeah.
PS0V4|Whatever you like dear it can bend round and.
PS0V6|Whatever you like.
PS0V6|it looks quite weird doesn't it Erm and I think I may do one in the middle of there and then leave that s like that.
PS0V4|But if you were to split that one and that one again can't you.
PS0V8|He's ever so stupid he'll.
PS0V6|Oh alright then.
PS0V8|lie down with his head sideways on the floor and his bottom still up in the air.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|No don't get thicker.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V6|Ha.
PS0V4|Oh I see that's your.
PS0V8|You're a daft dog baby.
PS0V4|yeah.
PS0V8|that's what it is cos you're still a baby really.
PS0V5|Yeah oh it's lovely to see him not shaking and coming over to you.
PS0V6|Yeah no mm.
PS0V8|It's certainly made a difference to him in that four days.
PS0V5|Oh yeah you're beautiful now.
PS0V6|You can't get any thinner than that.
PS0V5|Yes you are yeah you beautiful boy yeah.
PS0V6|Can you you can't get any.
PS0V4|Mhm.
PS0V6|than that.
PS0V4|So now you can work on that one.
PS0V6|That looks weird Mummy does that look weird.
PS0V5|No cos you'll fill it in with all the other branches.
PS0V4|Cos you you fill it in.
PS0V6|Yeah.
PS0V4|with other branches you see.
PS0V6|Don't worry about the lines in the middle and things like that because that's it's all gon na be shaded in.
PS0V5|Give your tummy.
PS0V6|So.
PS0V5|yes you are His tail now when it's down it's still down between his legs but it's li it's limp isn't it.
PS0V8|Yeah it's not curled up under.
PS0V5|No it was definitely pulled up under his.
PS0V8|Yes it's just down.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V8|Hanging there.
PS0V5|Mm perhaps it'll go to sleep on his cheek.
PS0V8|Isn't that lovely that other hostage got out.
PS0V5|Oh yeah.
PS0V8|There's only two German ones there now.
PS0V5|Yeah it's amazing really.
PS0V8|It happened so quickly hasn't it.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V6|Yeah it's going.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V6|it's going.
PS0V8|It's we it's once the ball start rolling it.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V8|get's everybody out.
PS0V6|Oh I'm gon na split that once more I think.
PS0V8|Stand all that.
PS0V5|I like dogs that sit like these I must admit.
PS0V8|Yeah so have I.
PS0V5|there's Fred then and Hipner and they all like being cuddled to don't they lovely Doesn't he look different to his other parts.
PS0V4|They needed to write.
PS0V8|Yes he does.
PS0V4|a bit more and start making a bit more.
PS0V8|Oh yeah.
PS0V4|Three D mm.
PS0V6|Right yes.
PS0V4|And how you can that you could draw imagine there's a branch.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V4|growing out that way and then curving up see what I mean.
PS0V6|Yes I se sort of growing up and then.
PS0V4|Mm but work so.
PS0V6|like that.
PS0V4|behind so it it's it's growing that way.
PS0V5|Are you gon na come down.
PS0V6|Mm.
PS0V8|No.
PS0V4|and then up so you scr draw it starting to coming up like that.
PS0V8|He's that bad in those.
PS0V6|Yeah or you can draw it.
PS0V8|Windy.
PS0V6|going up like those.
PS0V8|Windy.
PS0V6|on the bottom then.
PS0V8|No.
PS0V6|up like that and as it goes up it gets thinner.
PS0V8|Oi.
PS0V6|and thinner and thinner.
PS0V4|That's right.
PS0V6|like.
PS0V8|No I do it.
PS0V8|but I do it very artfully and turn my back.
PS0V4|It's that.
PS0V6|That so it looks as though it's going away.
PS0V4|Then you can split split it several times as well.
PS0V6|Oh mm.
PS0V8|What did they tell you about Fred and me.
PS0V6|I reckon that looks really sort of weird I don't know why.
PS0V4|Well draw.
PS0V5|I don't know.
PS0V4|It'll look less the more branches you draw.
PS0V6|Windy hello darling.
PS0V8|I'll talk to somebody else then.
PS0V4|the more real it will look like.
PS0V6|Yeah doesn't look.
PS0V4|Come on.
PS0V6|too realistic at the moment.
PS0V4|Well you wan na split it as often as you can.
PS0V6|Mm you saw where he had his thing done.
PS0V5|Mm slightly it's just a little so when he's head.
PS0V6|Oh yeah.
PS0V5|just a little tiny so that takes precedence.
PS0V6|Oh my god.
PS0V5|cos er it doesn't get in the way.
PS0V8|Ah occupied isn't he.
PS0V5|Yeah engaged you had it.
PS0V8|I'll talk to somebody else then.
