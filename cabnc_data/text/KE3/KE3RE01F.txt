PS0V5|Oh aren't they lovely.
PS0V4|What the jugs.
PS0V5|The jugs yeah.
PS0V4|Didn't see them properly.
PS0V5|They were like bunches of oranges and lemons.
PS0V4|Oh.
PS0V5|if you know what I mean.
PS0V4|Yeah I know.
PS0V4|In ceramic.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|A what.
PS0V6|A Pocket T V.
PS0V4|Pocket T V.
PS0V6|A radio the the cuddly toy er.
PS0V4|Good grief she's got a good memory.
PS0V6|The coffee maker the the er.
PS0V5|God she she was brilliant.
PS0V4|She got an awful lot of things didn't she There's a really good game we did at at Rammore for remembering people's names.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|And they it was a bit frightening because we were in a group of seventeen and see what I mean when I mean how it starts is like if were starting with me I have to say I'm Tony right and then you would say I'm Jackie and this is Tony and then Christine would say I'm Christine this is Jackie this is Tony I was at the end of a group of seventeen and I had heard it sort of you hear it it builds up round the room.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V6|We've had a game like that.
PS0V4|So that you can in the end when I came to do it although it was seventeen people I didn't find it too difficult.
PS0V5|No cos you just remember the order that you went round the room in and.
PS0V4|That's right well no these were people and some of the people I knew some of the people I hadn't met before.
PS0V5|Ah.
PS0V6|Daddy.
PS0V4|And so I had to sort of go round the room and say I'm Tony and this is and go all round and I got round the room.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|So you did quite well.
PS0V4|But I was surprised that I got round the room cos I'm awful at remembering names I think I'm gon na have to try and.
PS0V6|Dad do we have to we have to come up with a name.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V6|With a first name so I said her and Chris.
PS0V4|Oh yeah.
PS0V6|The man said.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V4|Erm but we had a that was that was quite good but I must there's a trick to remembering names and that is that you use it all the time so any time if you want to remember somebodys name every time you see them you say hello and there name.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|and that sort of imprints it on you.
PS0V5|Yes.
PS0V4|Cos I've noticed there is an awful lot of people do that to me.
PS0V5|Yeah I'm terrible for people's names.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0V5|I'm absolutely hopeless Places I can tell you I know somewhere looking at them and I think where do I know you from.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V5|Names ooh.
PS0V4|Yeah And that that can be difficult in training because you see so many people and they spend the week looking at you and they've got one name to remember but you've got eight or twelve names to remember.
PS0V5|Yeah.
PS0V4|and you see them a three weeks later and they say hello Tony and you think hello who the hell are you.
PS0V5|My watch is breaking up.
PS0V4|Breaking up.
