PS0V5|Well we'll have a sniff at it and see what it's like.
PS0V4|No we won't.
PS0V5|Why.
PS0V4|I'm talking about the milk that's in the training room.

PS0V4|Erm.
PS0V5|Do you think they.
PS0V4|well it's cartons.
PS0V5|ah.
PS0V4|and they're easier to get rid of I'd have to bring bottles home again wouldn't I.
PS0V5|Well yeah I suppose you would.
PS0V4|And I get the money back.
