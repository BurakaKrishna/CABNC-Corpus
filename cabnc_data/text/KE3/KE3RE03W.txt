PS0V4|I heard Brad having a conversation again today about Ooh I don't feel ye I heard him saying why don't we feel very happy about this and not and not happy with the subjects and I don't feel very happy about running the session so go up this way he's never done the work you see so he's trying to learn it from i instructions and things and a lot of the time you need to have actually done it to be able to talk about it.
PS0V8|Yeah from experience.
PS0V4|So it's not his his fault but a lot of the training that we have to deliver is to do with procedures that he hadn't dealt with whereas a lot of the procedures are things that I'm familiar with there's only some the job centre stuff.
PS0V8|It takes an awful lot of the different kind of practical experience.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V8|Text books don't teach you everything.
PS0V4|No and I've got the erm I haven't got any experience in job centre work.
PS0V8|No.
PS0V4|but the job centre work isn't as complicated.
PS0V8|No we had er the marriage certificate and that back.
PS0V4|Oh good.
PS0V8|Yeah so it must have been alright cos there was no letter it just said with the compliments and just take it to.
PS0V4|Right right.
PS0V8|two things back so.
PS0V4|So you have to assume everything's okay.
PS0V8|Yeah.
PS0V4|because they haven't told you.
PS0V8|They didn't so.
PS0V4|Good fine this is the way we operate.
