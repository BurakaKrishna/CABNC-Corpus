PS0V4|Right Who can claim income support.
PS0V7|Er to be over eighteen is it.
PS0V4|Erm some people under eighteen can claim Who are the main area of people that we deal with A generalization for most of the people we see coming in.
PS0V7|Most people.
PS0VC|Unemployed.
PS0V4|Unemployed.
KE3PSUN|Unemployed.
PS0V4|Yeah So people who are unemployed can claim income support Any other people apart from people who are unemployed that can claim income support.
PS0V8|Those on low incomes.
PS0V4|Low income yes Anyone else.
PS0V8|Training courses.
PS0V4|Training courses.
PS0V8|You know Like U T and.
PS0V4|Right They're actually paid a training allowance which is related to income support But it isn't their income support.
PS0V8|Mm.
PS0V4|So anything anyone else who might receive income support.
PS0V7|Old age pensioners.
PS0V4|Pensioners Yes Anyone else.
PS0V9|If you're disabled.
PS0V4|Erm yes but they normally receive their erm.
PS0V9|Disability allowance.
PS0V4|their own benefits Yes related to disability But yes they can if they don't receive enough from other means Yeah.
PS0V4|Yes.
PS0V7|It's what the government.
PS0VA|Think I heard that one That's quite an old one.
PS0V4|There's.
PS0V4|No it's alright.
PS0V4|There's erm there's one other erm group of people that might be able to claim.
PS0V7|One parent families.
PS0V4|Yeah Single parents That's another very common one Yep Single parents Right So what factors decide what you get under income income support.
KE3PSUN|Your income I suppose.
PS0V4|Erm.
PS0V7|means tested.
PS0V4|Yeah yeah So looking at somebody's needs and what are the sort of things they're likely to take into account.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V9|How many there are in the family.
PS0V4|Income Er how many in the family Yes Number of dep.
KE3PSUN|Number of children.
PS0V4|Number of children.
PS0V8|Is that opposed to the number of adults.
PS0V4|Erm.
PS0V8|as well as.
PS0V4|As well as.
PS0VC|Financial commitments.
PS0V4|Financial commitments.
KE3PSUN|Mortgage.
KE3PSUN|Housing.
PS0V4|Yes Mortgage will They will help with the mortgage What happens about rent.
PS0VA|Get some housing benefit.
PS0V4|Yeah They can claim housing benefit That isn't income support that's another benefit that they claim from the Local Authority So if they're in rented accommodation then they will need to make a claim to a Local Authority for that What other things might D S S take into account.
PS0V7|Poll tax.
PS0VA|Savings.
PS0V4|Er savings You mentioned poll tax Erm another another thing you can claim is relief from paying poll tax So it's not directly linked with income support You claim relief from the people who collect poll tax But the fact you are claiming income support is a factor that they look at So if you were in receipt of income support then you don't have to pay very much.
PS0V7|So who are these people then that you get relief from if you want help with your poll tax.
PS0V4|Right You would claim that from your Local Authority In the same way as housing benefit.
PS0V7|You've got housing benefit forms.
PS0V4|Yeah Yeah Okay Savings Erm something else that would relate to number of children adults is also the age The ages of the people in the house.
PS0V8|What just of the children or of the adults as well.
PS0V4|Well once they're over eighteen age is immaterial.
PS0V8|Oh Right.
PS0V4|But erm there there are a couple of different rates at which er income support is claimed depending on how old the child is.
PS0V8|Oh really.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0VA|What about the other er end of the scale Somebody over sixty five or seventy five or eighty.
PS0V4|Right As I understand it there's no no banding at that end.
PS0VA|That's strange isn't it Because there's a lot of erm pensions that are triggered off by the age of the elderly person.
PS0V4|Mm.
PS0VC|Of course there there are things I mean there is the pension There is also attendance allowance and there are various things like that which are outside this.
PS0V4|Mm Yeah But they will take into account any special help that is needed for somebody who's disabled.
PS0VA|Washing Extra extra money for wa if they've got lots of washing to do.
PS0V4|So you can get special help if somebody's disabled Oh you're right There's a pension as well.
PS0VA|Yeah.
PS0V4|Yes Yes Sorry.
PS0VA|That's alright.
PS0V4|Right So Let's have a look has any has anyone not seen erm B one.
KE3PSUN|No I haven't.
KE3PSUN|I'm not really.
PS0V4|Right.
KE3PSUN|Well I've only seen the back of it I've never looked right through it.
PS0V4|So how how many do we need.
KE3PSUN|All all.
PS0V4|You have a look between the two.
KE3PSUN|You've been reading B one's all week.
KE3PSUN|Have I.
KE3PSUN|You've been reading B one's for weeks haven't you.
PS0V4|Right Your rate of allowances aren't there because they go out of date so fast so I've got an extra you can have one of these each with the rate of allowances.
KE3PSUN|Thanks.
PS0V4|And there's also you may or may not have the erm form which you claim relief for community charge and housing benefit inside the form.
PS0V7|You have to have another one if you're in cou if you're not in council accommodation from the l which we issue as well.
PS0V7|You get so much stuff from the N CA's who do that The N CA's who do.
PS0V4|Right So can I wipe this side off.
PS0V8|Ooh That's not fair is it If you're eighteen to twenty four years old and you're bringing up a child on your own You get the same as twenty five years and older.
PS0V4|Right So if we look at a a typical family We have wife and husband both over eighteen Both over eighteen How much would they get.
PS0V8|Sixty two twenty five.
PS0V4|That's it Sixty two pounds twenty five Okay Now if they had a child who's four years old how much would they get.
KE3PSUN|Thirteen thirty five.
PS0V4|Thirteen thirty five.
KE3PSUN|For each child.
PS0V4|Okay And then another child who is sixteen.
PS0V4|Right That's right So What about if they're fourteen.
KE3PSUN|Nineteen seventy five.
PS0V4|Nineteen seventy five There you go And in addition to that there is a premium because they are a family And the premium because they have at least one child is seven pounds ninety nine ninety five.
PS0VB|So ev even if you had six children you'd still allowed still only get seven ninety five.
PS0V4|That's right In addition to the.
KE3PSUN|Yeah.
PS0V4|Yeah yeah Okay.
PS0V7|I doubt if you'd have six children under four would you.
PS0VB|You could have I suppose.
PS0V7|Oh well Going back to what Jerry said you'd.
PS0V4|So You've got a total income coming in er a total amount of benefit there of a hundred and three pounds thirty for this family Okay Now they will also be entitled to child benefit Okay So child benefit for two children it's ninety twenty five for the first Seven twenty five for the second So that sixteen pounds fifty.
PS0VB|What are those rates again Nine twenty five first and seven twenty five.
PS0V4|It's not.
KE3PSUN|Ah Sneaky peaky eh.
PS0V4|So the for the oldest child it's nine pounds twenty five Sorry it's not on there.
KE3PSUN|No.
PS0VB|What is it Ten pounds twenty five.
PS0V4|Nine twenty five for the first child And then seven pounds twenty five for subsequent children Making sixteen pounds fifty in total This would then be treated as income by D S S and so this amount would be reduced by sixteen pounds fifty.
PS0V7|That's a con in n it.
KE3PSUN|Mm.
PS0V4|I make that eighty six eighty Yeah.
KE3PSUN|Mm.
PS0V4|Now that's an idea to how they do it Don't try to counsel somebody and tell them how much income support they're going to get Because that's very very basic There are lots and lots of other things the D S S can take into account.
PS0V7|Leave it to the Citizen's Advice Bureau.
PS0V4|Yeah Leave it to the Citizen's Advice Bureau or the D S S.
PS0V7|I feel sorry for the D S S cos the Citizen's Advice Bureau to make sure that the people get all they're entitled to.
KE3PSUN|Mm.
PS0V7|The Citizen's Advice Bureau has got a pro forma which if a person goes in and says I think I ought to be getting I think I I don't think I'm getting sufficient income support or I'm going to apply for income support What should I get And they go through and tell them what they should get.
KE3PSUN|Mm.
PS0V7|Which I would find very trying if I was in the D S S quite honestly.
KE3PSUN|Yeah.
PS0V4|Right Now so having issued B one where's it got to go.
KE3PSUN|The D S S.
PS0V4|Right So it goes to the D S S Which one.
KE3PSUN|The one nearest.
KE3PSUN|The one in the area which in they live.
PS0V4|So it it's not specifically related to the benefit office where they're signing It's based on where they live And so you might find that some offices have to think of two or three D S S offices and refer various people to the to various ones Depending on where they live Okay Now when you had that bundle of handouts that are all stapled together.
PS0V4|There was a list of the D S S offices together with guidance on their address Now if I can check that you've all got that I you haven't I've got a list here that I can let you have It looks like that and then if you come across it later.
PS0VC|I was just wondering that.
PS0VC|Or is it it is in fact North Radstock isn't it The actual town is North Radstock.
PS0V4|Okay Any question so far.
PS0V4|Okay Right so when do you issue a B one.
KE3PSUN|At fresh claims Change of circumstances.
PS0V7|Fresh claims.
PS0V4|Fresh claims Er what do you mean by change of circumstances.
PS0V7|If they change their address or something or they live with somebody else or they move out from somewhere.
PS0V4|Yeah Erm change of let's say person's circumstances It might be limiting with a change of address it might not Yeah Any.
KE3PSUN|Also when they run out of U B.
PS0V4|When they run out of U B Yes Any other times when you might issue one Erm situation where you have somebody who has left their job Wasn't clear at the time what the circumstances were You may find when you have the reply back from the employer that you have to suspend unemployment benefit In that instance you could issue a B one so that he would have some money coming in So if unemployment benefit is suspended and erm another circumstance which might arise is somebody expects to receive unemployment benefit and then finds that they're not entitled to it Because of contribution problems.
PS0V7|If in doubt.
PS0V4|Yes.
PS0V7|always give a B one in my opinion.
PS0V4|Yes That's right They may the only thing is they may not wish to take one You don't have to you don't have to claim And they may say no no I don't want to claim In which case that's fair enough But at some future time they may decide they want to.
PS0V7|If a person refuses U B They should take you should issue them with a leaflet.
PS0V4|Sorry Refuses U B.
PS0V7|Issues refuses I S.
PS0V4|Mhm.
PS0V7|You should issue them with the basic leaflet telling them about I S.
PS0V4|Mhm.
PS0V7|So that they're aware of what they've refused.
PS0V4|That's a very good er very good precaution to take yes Very good idea.
PS0V7|I don't normally But you can do Well yes you can but if anyone refuses U B er I S rather I always give them a leaflet so that you are sure I'm not conning you.
PS0V4|So before we issue before we hand over the B one what do we do.
PS0V7|Fill in the back.
PS0V4|We fill in the back Yes We'll be giving you some exercises later about filling in the back Erm.
KE3PSUN|Who would do this then I mean it wouldn't just be anyone could do this fill out the back it doesn't have to be an E O does it.
PS0V4|No no it doesn't have to be an E O Right Erm the only thing is what does happen occasionally is somebody comes from the D S S offices and they've been told I need a B one What they haven't been told is that you actually have to make a claim for benefit And have to sign on every fortnight.
PS0V7|every day It happens every day Every day.
PS0V4|And yes And and so then they they're a bit miffed that instead of the B one they're being asked to complete a U B four six one a U B six seven one They then have to come to an appointment and be interviewed Whereas in actual fact I don't want all this I want is a B one But they have to make a claim before you can issue a B one.
KE3PSUN|And the D S S can't issue B ones unless they've gone through all the procedure.
PS0V4|That's right In fact D S S don't issue B ones.
PS0V4|We we have to issue B ones.
PS0V7|Because they have new people on the counter and it's it's.
PS0V4|Good question.
PS0V7|It happens every single day Go down and get a B one.
PS0V4|How long does it take for income support to come through Once a claim has been made.
KE3PSUN|According to the managers five and a half days in this area.
PS0V4|How long is a piece of string Five and a half days.
PS0V7|They can get it immediately get it immediately.
KE3PSUN|That's what I was quoted last week.
PS0V4|Right.
KE3PSUN|When I asked the self-same question He said five and a half days He hasn't.
PS0V7|The last time.
PS0V4|I I would I would have thought it could have could take it could easily take ten days.
KE3PSUN|Yeah Two weeks.
PS0VC|Two weeks.
PS0V7|When they had problems not so long ago it was taking a month.
KE3PSUN|Yeah I heard it was six weeks.
PS0V7|A month six weeks.
KE3PSUN|Well they have targets like we all have and one of their targets is how quickly they can turn around the claimant's money.
PS0V4|Mm.
KE3PSUN|What does a claimant do then they've got no money then for six weeks if it takes six weeks.
KE3PSUN|Come and bang on our door for six weeks.
PS0V7|They get I think they can.
KE3PSUN|Yeah.
PS0V4|They can get a crisis loan They don't they can also get paid early direct by the D S S D S S will actually pay them rather than telling us to pay them.
KE3PSUN|But is it up to them to actually go to D S S and say I want a payment now.
PS0V4|That's right So if you get someone in that situation who's saying I'm desperate for money I'm claiming income support I've heard nothing and you haven't been told how much they're entitled to Then they can actually go to the D S S office and say that they need some money urgently and D S S may make a payment.
KE3PSUN|But may but not nec.
PS0V7|May.
KE3PSUN|May not.
PS0V4|Yeah It depends on the circumstances and you're not you're not in a position to say what D S S will or won't do So you can only say they may make a payment.
PS0V4|under er I think they would do under most circumstances It would only be if they suspected that something odd was going on Okay and how do D S S tell us how much to pay income support.
KE3PSUN|B two.
PS0V4|Yep B two Right Before I ask you to complete B one there's one more thing we need to talk about And that is about what happens when someone leaves a job of their own accord So what happens when someone leaves a job of their own accord what happens to their unemployment benefit.
KE3PSUN|Suspended.
PS0V7|Suspended pending enquiries.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V7|But not it's suspended it's suspended but it's not disallowed.
PS0V4|That's right So what what's the difference.
PS0V7|Well it's suspended pending enquiries so it's in suspension They we're looking into the reasons And if erm they don't like the outcome of our deliberations they have a right of appeal.
PS0V4|Right But when when the adjudication officer has made a decision he will then allow or disallow So that that's the so at first the claim is suspended And then when you have a decision from the adjudication officer it is then allowed or disallowed.
KE3PSUN|And then they can appeal.
PS0V4|And then they can appeal.
KE3PSUN|If they wish.
PS0V4|Yeah.
KE3PSUN|It used to be six months didn't it and now it's gone up to.
PS0V4|That's right yes.
KE3PSUN|Big jump isn't it.
PS0V4|Well It went up in stages.
KE3PSUN|Oh did it.
PS0V4|It went to thirteen weeks and then it went to twenty six weeks.
KE3PSUN|Did it.
PS0V4|Yeah.
PS0V7|As a deterrent Which it never has had any effect on at all That was the reason behind it It was a a deterrent to people giving up their jobs but nobody knew about it People don't know about it now.
PS0VC|So if they immediately fall back on is I mean it.
PS0V4|Yeah that's just what I was going to say What happens then to income support.
KE3PSUN|Paid at a reduced rate.
PS0V4|It's paid at a reduced rate for the period of the suspension.
KE3PSUN|I thought if it's disqualifying if you were disqualified then income support pays normal.
PS0V7|No.
PS0V4|Sorry it's it's if it's allowed they would have a reason income support to pay If it's disallowed then erm they would have their entitlement in that they would be paid a reduced rate during the period of the susp er of the disallowance.
KE3PSUN|And would they still get the income support after that but still at a reduced rate or not.
PS0V4|Right Once we're out of the twenty six week period it would go back to its normal rate.
KE3PSUN|I think we're talking about once the suspension was over.
KE3PSUN|Yeah.
KE3PSUN|and the adj the A O has made the decision disallowed.
PS0V4|Mhm.
KE3PSUN|they'd carry on getting the reduced rate prior to the period of disallowance.
PS0V4|That's right yes.
KE3PSUN|They'd still get paid then.
PS0V4|Yes but at a reduced reduced rate.
KE3PSUN|What is the reduced rate.
PS0V4|I'm sorry I'll go on to talk about that.
PS0V7|Is there a handout on this because.
PS0V4|Right I've got a handout on the reduced rate yes And I'm gon na be giving you a handout which gives you information about how to calculate it.
PS0V7|I never tell people getting a reduced rate.
PS0V7|Well no because they just go bananas if you do You've got to be careful.
PS0V4|What what do we call that reduction deduction.
PS0V7|U D.
PS0V4|Right Yep I don't know if you've heard that term at all around What does it stand for.
PS0VC|The deduction.
PS0V4|Yep oh Let's try that again Unemployed deduction Okay Details of any reductions that have been made are held in enquiry screen four The reduction is made on the personal rate available So in this instance it would be made on half if if the husband had left his job of his own accord it would be made on half of that amount.
KE3PSUN|Surely that's for his wife as well so she.
PS0V7|No.
PS0V4|No no no No that's why it would only be it would be made your deduction would be made on half of that amount.
KE3PSUN|Oh I see.
PS0V4|No no The deduction is based on.
KE3PSUN|The deduction isn't half that amount.
PS0V4|No.
KE3PSUN|it's made on half that amount.
PS0V4|It's yeah And it is forty percent of that.
PS0V7|Made on the.
PS0V4|So.
PS0V7|So can you give us on that.
PS0V4|Yes.
PS0V7|You've got.
PS0V4|I'm just trying to.
PS0V7|The man's would be sixteen erm.
PS0V4|Thirty one.
PS0V7|thirty one pounds whatever on the twelve thirty p.
KE3PSUN|Yeah.
PS0V7|So it it's forty percent of thirty two pounds Yes.
PS0V4|Yep That's right.
PS0V7|Reduction then on the personal sorry can you repeat what you said about the reduction is made made on the personal.
PS0V4|Yes It's made on the amount that that person that individual is receiving in income support It's not on the whole family.
PS0V7|family should be penalized.
PS0V4|Yeah Just the the individual and that one portion of the income support is reduced by forty percent.
KE3PSUN|So what's forty percent of thirty one pound twenty five Erm erm.
PS0V4|Yeah It's about twelve pounds a week.
PS0V7|What happens if you if you're not on that rate.
KE3PSUN|What if you're a single person only getting thirty nine something.
PS0V7|Then you doesn't need much does he.
KE3PSUN|But do you get the reduced rate is it reduced forty percent for all sort of categories whether you're married single.
PS0V4|Yes yes.
PS0V7|I thought there were exceptions if the person was pregnant or something If there's a pregnant person in the house.
PS0V4|Yes There are exceptions So that the majority of people will be subject to a forty percent deduction on their personal benefit and their personal rate Okay.
KE3PSUN|That's irrespective whether they're married or single.
PS0V4|That's right Erm the deduction will only made be made if a suspension is held on our computer So if somebody forgets to put the suspension on.
PS0V7|It's not actually cos it causes real problems In other words it can take doing that person no good service like if there's any doubt suspending it immediately They can always get the arrears And they get very uptight if they get erm too much and then it's reduced rather than the other way round.
PS0V4|Mm.
KE3PSUN|Can I ask.
PS0V4|Yeah.
KE3PSUN|queries at the end.
PS0V4|No No that's fine.
KE3PSUN|I'm still a bit confused about erm sorry I should have brought this up at the time.
PS0V4|It's alright.
KE3PSUN|Claims suspended for twenty six weeks by our good selves.
PS0V4|Yes.
KE3PSUN|therefore if they apply for income support.
PS0V4|Mhm.
KE3PSUN|that is also reduced by forty percent.
PS0V4|Yeah.
KE3PSUN|Right What if they're unemployment benefit was disqualified The adjudication officer we suspend it the adjudication officer says right they're not supposed to have it What happens to their income support do they still continue to receive it at a reduced rate.
PS0V4|That's right For the period of the disallowance And it would then revert back to full rate.
KE3PSUN|And the disallowance can be.
PS0V7|Up to twenty six weeks.
PS0V4|Yeah.
KE3PSUN|thank you.
PS0V4|Okay Right Erm the some people can actually have a reduction made of twenty percent instead If in this family the wife was expecting a baby then then it would be a twenty percent deduction Also if one or other of the partners well it would have to be the partner that wasn't signing was seriously ill then the reduct deduction would be twenty percent Providing there's a condition attached that they have savings of less than two hundred pounds.
KE3PSUN|What if the claimant should become seriously ill.
PS0V7|sick.
KE3PSUN|Sick.
KE3PSUN|Do they get a reduced rate on the sickness benefit.
KE3PSUN|No.
KE3PSUN|No They get more on sickness benefit than they do on.
PS0V7|And another thing if you're living with somebody and and you're both unemployed If the person that's got the sack doesn't make the claim but the other person claims then it doesn't affect them either If you see what I mean.
KE3PSUN|Oh I see so er you're assuming then that the person that was claiming isn't working.
PS0V7|Wasn't wasn't Isn't working but hasn't had the sack Perhaps they've been made redundant Perhaps their partner's had the sack If the person that has had been made redundant to make the claim can claim for the other person and there's no red.
KE3PSUN|dependent yeah.
PS0V7|Yeah so there's no reduction on that.
KE3PSUN|suspension for three hundred and twelve days very often find knowing that they've left voluntarily to have babies and have decided not to go back to the job although the job's been kept open for them They're disallowed for six months and then coming and.
PS0V4|Right I hope this doesn't cause you a problem but the rates of benefit have changed very slightly since the first of October ninety one And the handout I've got here which I couldn't tie in just now when I was trying to do the deduction is because the rates are very slightly different It's about thirty pence or so more Than actually what we were talking about So I'm sorry about that I'll get the other one updated Erm but what you've got now if you can I pass those round and I'll explain what that says.
KE3PSUN|Is this one the same as we've got in that erm wad again.
PS0V4|Oh you had one in the wad did you.
KE3PSUN|Yes I had one yeah else did but I.
PS0V7|In the one that we shouldn't have had which we did have.
PS0V4|Oh it's been a good week.
PS0V4|Right If you'd have a look at that The appendix age twenty the category which you can see there nought to four That tells you the amount of income support which the deduc er for which the deduction is appropriate.
KE3PSUN|Hang on a minute Are we looking at.
KE3PSUN|No we're looking at page two yeah.
KE3PSUN|Right.
PS0V7|I've got April ninety one here.
PS0V4|Right some are April some of October and they're all mixed up.
KE3PSUN|I'm April.
PS0V4|Wonderful.
KE3PSUN|I'm October.
PS0V4|Okay October you want you want anyone else need October.
KE3PSUN|Yes please.
PS0V4|And if you please destroy the other one.
PS0V4|Yeah that's the latest one Right Okay have a look at that The B U category nought to four That shows the amount of weekly rate to which the can be applied So that shows how much we're gon na apply our deduction to Okay And we can see the rates for which the deduction is going to be applied the other side So erm a single under eighteen or couple both under eighteen twenty three pound ninety That re that should relate to the allowances you had before.
PS0V7|And that's so that's twelve fifty five if it's.
PS0V4|So if a forty percent deduction is made on category two then somebody receiving thirty one pounds forty a week would actually it would actually be reduced by twelve pounds fifty five Do you see how that works.
KE3PSUN|Mm.
KE3PSUN|No sorry I've lose where that twelve fifty five comes from.
PS0V4|Right If you look at category two.
KE3PSUN|What here.
PS0V4|Yeah.
KE3PSUN|Yeah right.
PS0V4|They're in receipt of thirty one pounds forty.
KE3PSUN|Yeah.
PS0V4|So if you look at category two down below Forty percent deduction applied for a full week Twelve pound fifty five.
KE3PSUN|Oh right twelve fifty five yeah Mhm Yeah okay.
PS0V4|Okay So the B U category shows the amount of income support that er is being that the deduction is being based on And then the B U indicator indicates whether it's rate one or rate two and indicates whether it's a twenty percent or forty percent deduction Now right at the beginning of a claim you can have an odd number of days before the first benefit week ending day There will also be an indicator on the B two to say how those days should be treated There will be a number which will be the number should be the number of days before the benefit week ending day in the first week of the claim Right Any questions on that.
KE3PSUN|Well only one and that is.
PS0V4|Mhm.
KE3PSUN|you've given us this information.
PS0V4|Right.
KE3PSUN|But don't tell them what they're likely to receive.
PS0V4|Yes.
KE3PSUN|So the information that is given us is for our information only or.
PS0V4|Right You can go so far as to say that I mean you will be safe in saying that if your that as your benefit is suspended your income support for you not for your family but for you will be reduced It will probably be reduced by forty percent Yeah.
KE3PSUN|Yeah.
PS0V7|But if you if you look at a B two it makes sense I mean I've looked at B two's and I haven't really understood what the one's two's and three's are for but now it makes sense to me so people who are B two makes more sense to them to know what.
PS0V4|Yeah We'll be having a look at some B two's and we'll pick up this bit about and er the coding when you have a look at that.
KE3PSUN|It's knowing how much information you can supply and how much you keep out isn't it.
PS0V4|Yes Yes that's right.
KE3PSUN|You know Cos what we give to the client.
PS0V4|Okay Right So I've now got a handout for you and it'll be up to date about how to complete a B one.
PS0V4|Yeah anybody else want to stretch their legs a second No Okay.
KE3PSUN|handouts Some of them are quite hard to read.
PS0V4|Yes this this one this new one ought to get it retyped.
PS0V7|It's quite an important one really.
PS0V4|Mm yeah.
PS0V7|I'm using it all the time.
PS0V4|I've got better copies of the blank B one but the handout is getting rather Right so if we're looking at we'll complete the B one Note the reverse of the U B A T B that we're issuing and pass it to the client with an envelope to send to the right D S S office.
KE3PSUN|Sorry which is the A T B I can't remember is it.
PS0V4|That's that's the one er the shopping list.
KE3PSUN|Oh the shopping list yeah.
PS0V7|I hate to tell you the D S S are on an economy campaign and they no longer issue envelopes.
PS0V4|They no longer issue envelopes.
PS0V7|At least they don't in Bath and you have to write the address on the front.
KE3PSUN|Oh they don't.
KE3PSUN|They don't do here either.
PS0V7|And then if it's in another area which invariably is if you've got to give them somewhere like Trowbridge or sometimes erm in Bath or Chippenham You then have to ring up D S S to find the address.
PS0V4|Well hopefully all this will give you the address although it depends how far away it is contact D S S to get the address.
PS0V7|Actually it's stupid that business about the envelopes.
PS0V4|Mm.
