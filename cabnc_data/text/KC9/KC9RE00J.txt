PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|mainly because of hard work self induced he was just a compulsive workaholic.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|and he loved what he did he that nobody could have survive and then my mother who's mentally unimpaired but in sudden decay overnight and she has to look after him.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|but having said that she's got a sort of ready meal all you have to do is use one hand either pick your plate up put it in the microwave and you've got a cooked meal.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|and on his own and said to mum come up here and get away for the weekend cos it's a hell of a burden to carry with no release I mean even going on holiday she has to book it organise his packing wash it you name it.

PS0CG|Stop it no Come come come come on as your told.
PS0CR|Erm and I said to him you will help me won't you you won't go back to me doing everything oh lord he said I'll I'll do my share so we went back to a routine whereby I did washing ironing cooking cleaning washing the car mowing the lawn doing the flower beds and the doing the he walked the dog.

PS0CR|And I was never terrible short sorry Henry didn't mean to tread on you Never take note not down here it's full of leaves and you'll never find it again I never saw that it was quite in balance but you know you just it's a case if somebody else doesn't do something and you can't stand looking at it you will get on and do it.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CR|which is something they get to rely on and I should keep thinking that's a hell of a for them because he's never in all our married life washed a sock.
PS0CG|No.
PS0CR|I mean clean clothes just magically appeared and ironed.

PS0CR|It's not just the cooking I mean he can cook but you need somebody else to say what are we going to have and either go and buy it or this and that and.
PS0CG|They don't think about it.
PS0CR|It's all that.
PS0CG|What about the clearing up when they have when they have cooked.
