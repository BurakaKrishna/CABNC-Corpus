PS0CG|yes I haven't heard of for ages.
PS0CH|No no you talk to Mary you know.
PS0CG|Do you ever hear from her.
PS0CH|She does but she doesn't know how from what I can make out she doesn't know how long much longer is going to stick at Reading or she's going to do her usual stick at something for two two months.
PS0CG|Reading.
PS0CH|Reading she's she got herself I told you she got herself a place in Reading College to do her an English A Level.
PS0CG|Oh Reading you see I think of Reading Berkshire.
PS0CH|Yeah that's right Reading Berkshire.
PS0CG|Oh no you didn't tell me.
PS0CH|Didn't I.
PS0CG|No.
PS0CH|Oh well she did.
PS0CG|No that would of stuck in my mind.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|She moved down to Reading.
PS0CH|She got herself a job in Reading college she got somebody to take her down there and a place to get an English A Level and Mary said it's a thing with her she wants to get this English A Level cos her father had one and she feels that is she could get and English A Level it would impress him he she spends her life trying to impress her father who doesn't really takes much notice of her.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CH|And she started off quite well there she was a little bit erm lonely and missed her and everything but she gave the appearance sticking it out until I spoke to Mary last time when she said oh.
PS0CG|She must of got a grant.
PS0CH|She she's there on Social Security which means she can only do part time education because if you're on the Social Security you have to available to do a job.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CH|so that.
PS0CG|Which is reasonable isn't it.
PS0CH|yes so so that you can only do education part time So Mary said she she came back up to the a little while ago she said she didn't get do something.
PS0CG|Mm mm.
PS0CH|and even an English A Level's not much good to her yet she.
PS0CG|She should do what Dinda done I mean Dinda went to evening school for her computer.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|A Level while she was working during the day.
PS0CH|Mm This is this is it.
PS0CG|Paid for her to help.
PS0CH|Erm living there because all can do at the moment is work in a shop or a restaurant or something like that and she doesn't get paid as much as she'll get on Social Security so it's not worth it.
PS0CG|It's terrible.
PS0CH|it's terrible awful showing her sense of responsibility and doing what she says she's going to do.
PS0CG|Wouldn't she of done better to take erm a six month's course in secretarial skills.
PS0CH|Well Mary said if I thought for a minute that she would stick at it I would pay for her but.
PS0CG|Yes yes.
PS0CH|she won't she's she's just on the oh I don't want to work in a boring office we've we've tried to say not you don't have to work it's an in it's an in to what you want.
PS0CG|Exactly.
PS0CH|to do you you get into the boring office and sort of yeah yeah.
PS0CG|it opens the door it opens the door that's why both my younger girls I mean Diane's a different policy any way cos she wants to be a but with the other two who worked interest in computers and when they left college I gave them crash course in in typing not in shorthand because they don't they don't need shorthand nowadays.
PS0CH|Really don't need that now no.
PS0CG|but I find it useful.
PS0CH|Well yes but I mean it now they do audio typing and computing don't they doesn't computing.
PS0CG|Yes yes that's right they use yeah but I insisted that it were open doors for you as jobs were so hard to get I said it were open doors for you and it did it helped them both.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|Once you're keyboard.
PS0CG|keyboard something.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|you've got a keyboard skill and they they can teach you.
PS0CG|these word processors and.
PS0CH|they were talking.
PS0CG|Oh yeah oh you talk to him.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|I think I.
PS0CH|Anyway it it doesn't alter the fact that if she wanted to do something erm really.
PS0CG|Last I heard she was living with her for.
PS0CH|well she wasn't she was according to her she she was allowed to use pity because she she could I said to Derek could have been so nice you and her a little firm together working for the good of the two of you.
PS0CG|That's it.
PS0CH|now all all that's Mary.
PS0CG|But I mean a lot of people don't glorify on the jobs they do I mean Dinda she said you know it's awful being the one who's getting all the all day long kind of explained and help them with their problems sympathise with with something that doesn't work she'd much rather be outdoors than being a or looking after but she said you know it's it's a secure job and these days I think well I'm not I run my own car and they don't really think that.
PS0CH|Well then somehow other people seemed to be.
PS0CG|Think she's absolutely recession on so many people.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|all day long I'm getting phone call from.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|Erm.
PS0CH|People who camcorder or a camera or a video video camera.
KC9PSUN|they do say that that one.
PS0CH|microwave.

PS0CG|No.
PS0CH|microwave a new vacuum cleaner or whatever I mean all the things they make music centre that is a luxury really.
KC9PSUN|Most people are buying those sort of things.
PS0CG|I know it's one of the last things I'd would.
PS0CH|Vacuum cleaner yes.
PS0CG|Mm Having been through the spate of using a clapped out vacuum cleaner that didn't do its job and how different it is now.
PS0CH|Yes.
PS0CG|that I've got one that works.
PS0CH|I remember when Miriam got married they had nothing.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CH|they had their.
PS0CH|It was the only thing they had they'd got nothing except I think it was.
PS0CG|I didn't get a vacuum cleaner.
PS0CH|we we got our washing machine washing machine remember it we used to bolt it to the floors.
PS0CG|Yes yes.
PS0CH|we we weren't allowed to have that one until we could pay for it outright.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CG|Didn't have a fridge.
PS0CH|No no.
PS0CG|Not until after we.
PS0CH|no.
PS0CG|moved to Maidenhead.
PS0CH|not until you could pay for it you didn't do go.
PS0CG|Remember my washing machine where I used to turn the handle at the top heat it up with gas.
PS0CH|Yeah yeah yeah.
PS0CG|and if I'd got something big and heavy you used to say to me bring it down and put it in my big machine.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|I used to bring down quilts and my machine wasn't big enough and in any case I couldn't possibly lift them once they were.
PS0CH|No no.
PS0CG|full of water.
PS0CH|no but nowadays the the machines don't take mind you because it was take a lot of water waste.
PS0CG|Mm.
PS0CH|Nowadays it's.
PS0CG|Don't they don't they have.
PS0CH|I know I know if I've got a towel in mine or a big thing and and it's all happens to be on one side.
PS0CG|One side.
PS0CH|of the the drum and it starts to erm spin.
PS0CG|yeah.
PS0CH|the whole thing goes woof and it all seems.
PS0CG|Really.
PS0CH|to move to one side yeah cos it's standing in an area and it isn't flat against.
PS0CG|That seems rather something heavy.
PS0CH|Mm mm.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CG|But I often look back and think well if was the girls who insisted that it's time mum had a proper automatic washing machine.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|and then only had it four years but I used to it was it's such a waste that washing machine I think maybe I've done a few shirts hand washing and all the water whereas in the twin tub I'd of done the light weights heated the water up done the shirts and erm got the put in maybe towels and then I'd put the water if if it wasn't really soiled and I could do either all the dogs stuff or or my dusters.
PS0CH|Yeah mm.
PS0CG|and then after that you've got all the water left and it cleaned the sink as you as the pump pumped it out you could go quickly with a brush round the sink and suds cleaned all the sink for you or you could with your pail.
PS0CH|Yeah or or even with the garden.
PS0CG|Oh yes I used to save it for the garden too.
PS0CG|Now now with it the one thing in that's it and all the water's wasted you can't it for anything.
PS0CH|No.
PS0CG|I suppose I could if I could pull the machine out and were were the pipe goes over into the waste I mean people do that in the Isle of Wight aren't they were they've got to need to.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|they unhook their washing machine.
PS0CH|Oh yeah yeah.
PS0CG|and they put it into a a an old bath or anything.
PS0CH|yeah.
PS0CG|an old tank yeah so that they can save the water and use it for other things.
PS0CH|yeah Mm.
PS0CG|once he said girls I will get your mother a proper washing machine I agree she shouldn't move the heavy towels garden.
