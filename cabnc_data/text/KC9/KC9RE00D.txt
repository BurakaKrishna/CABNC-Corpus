PS0CG|Surely that's the that is the house where Queen Elizabeth the first spent all her girl hood.
PS0CJ|I've no idea.
PS0CG|perhaps it was burnt down and re-built or something didn't seem at all tudorish did it.
PS0CG|You think all the big houses in London that are now official Government all along the strand big private houses Savoy Palace The.
PS0CJ|Mm.
PS0CG|Way back in the thirteen fourteenth century.

PS0CJ|Mm I'm still amazed about eighty gardens though.
PS0CG|Eighty gardens oh made me laugh.
PS0CJ|Well that's not what amazes me eighty gardens.
PS0CG|Eighty gardens but then as a place that size and the didn't have any machinery don't forget everything had to be.
PS0CJ|Well I expect now they've got about five.
PS0CG|I should think they probably still in the in the high season I should think they probably still need fifteen twenty.
PS0CJ|Oh look tractor.
PS0CG|I think it still belongs to the Duke of Devonshire because he was interviewed at the end wasn't he.
PS0CJ|Mm.
PS0CG|And he said they have to systematically sell something to keep the place up.
