PS0CG|Parker Park come on come on I was talking to Alison saying that sometimes I think we spend too much money keeping all these erm criminally in sane.
PS0CK|Yeah.
PS0CG|I said to her it's all very well but we spend so much money on them and we don't seem to spend any money on victims.
PS0CH|No.
PS0CG|And she said sometimes I can agree with you she said but some of them when they come into a library you feel helped.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|and others really victim I said but isn't it isn't it kinder in a way I wouldn't if they really are sick in their minds then but for the grace of god wouldn't it be kinder to stick a needle in their bottoms when they were asleep so they didn't wake up again.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|and she said well we've got for instance one of my favourite patience is the girl of er I think she's nineteen and er she's in their because her father had raped her since she was about eight when she was sixteen she killed him well I said well I think she should have been given a medal.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|Hello hello hello.
PS0CG|I've forgotten your name Judy oh sitting down in the meadow I think oh aren't you having fun come on Rocket oh Rock Rock Rock you Rocket I hide he get's every so anxious if I hide.
PS0CG|didn't bring your lead did I It was on the back seat well this girl apparently erm would of got away of killing her father.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|because he had abused her all those years erm but apparently she's also got a not the right sort of word a pathological hate for men in general.
PS0CH|Oh oh yeah.
PS0CG|and was inclined any man who accidently put a hand on her.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|likely to of had a have a knife in her pocket and turned round and stabbed him.
PS0CH|Yeah well you can't blame her can you.
PS0CG|No I can't blame her.
PS0CH|But I suppose you have to.
PS0CG|But it seems to me she shouldn't be locked up in Broadmoor she should be somewhere where it's more supervision but more freedom where she can walk around gardens and places like that erm.
PS0CH|well she should after a while.
PS0CG|Yes if they put you in a.
PS0CH|grow older.
PS0CG|close order with nuns or.
PS0CG|understand especially is one of them was a.
PS0CH|beat her up while he was while she's asleep didn't actually do it while he was actually abusing her so.
PS0CG|I mean a woman that frightened we all be seething inside and of course seeing him asleep in a drunken stupor to think now's my chance she must of been in a terrible state emotionally.
PS0CH|Yes.
PS0CG|and thought now's my chance if I.
PS0CH|She couldn't of done anything to him while he was abusing her.
PS0CG|No.
PS0CH|because he did it.

PS0CG|It was cold.
PS0CH|Wouldn't set foot outside.
PS0CG|Cold over the meadow then.
PS0CH|Do you know how if you've got a lot of toadstools and fungus in your in your garden you have to dig down don't you it said about six inches down.
PS0CH|That little pouch in the front where I have flowers in in the summer absolutely covered in toadstools it's all the way round there it's all covered in toadstools What what I do.
PS0CG|They're probably edible.
PS0CH|Oh dear the thing is as as far as I can remember I can't find it in any of the two books that I've got out at the moment it's not under but I vaguely remember that you have to dig down a certain.
PS0CG|It's not very deep thought is it.
PS0CH|No it's like.
PS0CG|Watching the television.
PS0CH|or something like that.
PS0CG|yeah and you should turn the top few inches over and there was what he called the.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|thing is if you don't get them out then they'll grow up again.
PS0CH|Unfortunately I haven't got any spare earth to put it.
PS0CG|I've got an idea I read that salt of course kitchen salt does it which I imagine would kill most any thing.
PS0CH|Well yes.
PS0CH|Yes and it might kill the flowers off but.
PS0CG|It was just that erm if you do it gently layer by layer.
PS0CH|Yes.
PS0CG|you'll probably come across those little.
PS0CH|yes.
PS0CG|interlaced mats.
