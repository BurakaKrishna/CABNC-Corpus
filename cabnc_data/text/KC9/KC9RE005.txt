PS0CJ|It's of money isn't it.
PS0CG|Well the bill's nearly three hundred pound.
PS0CJ|Oh oh.
PS0CH|Jesus.
PS0CJ|Now that wouldn't be feasible in your case because So what we'd have to do is trade him in.

PS0CG|Being what.
PS0CH|Well I've been holding it to save it.

PS0CH|Ooh I feel as if I want to it hurts and I feel as if I want to move it.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CH|He's told me be very bloody careful cos it can go out just like that.
PS0CG|But he did tell you to move.
PS0CH|Oh yes but very very gently He said tell it you're going to move Don't do anything sudden Tell it you're gon na move I like the way he puts it.

PS0CG|In Mrs's surgery There were two doggies in their pens still sparkers you know where they've had things.
PS0CH|What'd do they do Do they keep the doggie under sedation whilst he's healing up How long has he been there.
PS0CG|Oh yes No no Herbie's not under sedation.
PS0CH|How long was he in there.
PS0CG|Just over a night operation.
PS0CH|Oh he's had all that done.
PS0CG|Yeah Did the operation.
PS0CH|How does he feel in himself.
PS0CG|Well he was he heard Audrey's voice in the waiting room.
PS0CJ|Pretty bloody awful.
PS0CG|and he was whining She said it's alright Herbie I'm here and he for a minute And I said he's gon na do damage if he's trying to get up at the door.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|the way a little Dachsie would you see.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|So we talked to him but erm we didn't actually see Mrs until about a quarter to eleven And she said you know on no account must he strain Obviously he's got dissolving stitches in On his insides And she said there was so little muscle left It had been so stretched and strained by But she had to do the best she could Peter will And of course Audrey's not too quick on her feet you see since she broke her hip So I was trying to help Audrey and that and help Herbie So Herbie didn't try and jump in the car before I could lift him and trying to get Audrey in with her stiff leg And then get the rug across her She didn't turn a hair when she said two hundred and ninety three pounds.
PS0CJ|I suppose it's like anything You get an estimate for it.
PS0CG|Well it's cheaper than I suppose.
PS0CJ|Parts and labour Parts and labour.
PS0CH|Eh.
PS0CJ|Does it come with a three month guarantee.
PS0CG|Cheaper than princess princess Margaret or No Mrs said she was very lucky She'd been to three lectures One of the topmost veterinary surgeons in Europe.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|And that's why Mrs asked her to do it She'd actually seen it done Seen slides and been to lectures on it I don't know it must be wonderful to be able to mend To rebuild his rear end.
PS0CH|Hope he comes out of it.
PS0CG|Well as long as nothing breaks nothing gets No now way must he strain so she's she's got some liquid paraffin to drop on his dinner.
PS0CG|Quite a major operation He's been ever so bright Walking about quite well he did turn to lick his under his tail but his little tail was wagging And he was walking fine He even stopped and had a tinkle.
PS0CH|See they don't know it's to hurt.
PS0CG|No no No I think I think animals are fantastic they way they put up with pain Because they can't tell you And after a major operation there he was wagging his tail and.
