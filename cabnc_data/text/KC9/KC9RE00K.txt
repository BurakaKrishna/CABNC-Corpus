PS0CG|Come on come on it's a horrible noise isn't it.
PS0CG|Oh yes it's just under growth.
PS0CR|You know we were saying about erm.
PS0CG|Foxes and rabbits.
PS0CR|Claire and.
PS0CG|Yeah oh great.
PS0CG|Great But I found that.
PS0CR|But erm.
PS0CG|now I mean my girls used to come to me with boy boy friends as they grew up and then husbands but they always help they always.
PS0CR|yeah.
PS0CG|helped with the bedrooms and things like that you see.
PS0CR|now that's what I the family would do.
PS0CG|the clearing up they always gave a hand but even so they they didn't realise that the three weeks before hand.
PS0CR|The sheer graft of trading round the shops getting it all in humping it all home.
PS0CG|The lists the planning the food.
PS0CR|packing it all away.
PS0CG|Yes yes and all the rest of it.
PS0CR|and all the rest of it Oh my god.
PS0CG|My husband's eh never bought the Christmas presents he buys one and usually he'd only get that from one of the girls what shall I get mum can you do.
PS0CR|So he doesn't actually go out and do.
PS0CG|He doesn't have to do anything but about four Christmas's ago I had the whole lot down I had nine of us for the whole Christmas week erm Boxing Day I went in the kitchen two of Diane's friends had arrived who lived in London and I went in the kitchen I'd had a bad dose of the flu virus that was.
PS0CR|Oh.
PS0CG|going around and I'd worked right through it because of all the Christmas preparation.
PS0CR|we don't have another option do you.
PS0CG|and I went into the kitchen and I fell down first time in my life I've never passed out not.
PS0CR|That's right.
PS0CG|even in pregnancies or anything.
PS0CR|mm.
PS0CG|next thing I remember was being undressed and in bed with Debbie standing there with a boiled egg on a tray saying mummy were so sorry you'll never do Christmas again you've done it for us for forty years we shall do it for you now.
PS0CR|Oh bless her cotton socks.
PS0CG|And they have ever since.
PS0CR|Oh bless them and let them keep on doing it.
PS0CG|But there again you see I go in the kitchen and say right want to do spuds.
PS0CR|Here I am shall I start on this or do you want me to do that I know.
PS0CG|Yeah what would you like me to do.
PS0CR|Yes.
PS0CG|If I say if you want me out of the kitchen just say so I don't want to be under your feet.
PS0CR|But if absolutely you won't go quietly but.
PS0CG|And they either say go and read the paper mum I'll call you in half an hour.
PS0CR|Yes and then you'll feel you don't want to be yes absolutely I know.
PS0CG|And we get on fine.
PS0CR|It takes you a long while to realise what a twit you've been for so long.
PS0CG|Yes Oh bless their hearts they'd always helped but they hadn't realised I think.
PS0CR|Yes but until you are the one who does it you have no comprehension of what is involved.
PS0CG|Yes yes Diane was the first.
PS0CR|This year I have my mummy and my daddy coming up for a couple of days and that will be fine.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CR|I enjoy.
PS0CG|But I'm.
PS0CR|looking after them.

PS0CR|Oh which is the one that is pregnant with the terrible time.
PS0CG|That's Debbie she's she's she'll be thirty this month.
PS0CR|Yes it's a funny old thing actually I must tell you I feel an awful lot better since I've passed my I suppose last Friday I saw a Solicitor and the divorce is now actually sat up on it's merry way rejoicing and.
PS0CG|I think you're much better off.
PS0CR|for the first time since he went.
PS0CG|I envy you.
PS0CR|I actually slept the entire night because I thought goody as soon as the divorce goes off the sooner I'm on my way out of the ar oh Rocky Rocky your head was in the way it was your own silly fault.
PS0CG|He's got nothing left he's got nothing left.
PS0CR|he's probably widdleing nothing poor that wasn't worth sitting down for no to think that once I've gone on which I did on Friday I'm now on my way out the other end.
PS0CR|it's absolute bliss.
PS0CR|Yes I think I do.
PS0CG|Oh.
PS0CR|I was talking to my girls honestly say it never crosses my mind.
PS0CG|On my own with with.
PS0CR|to think I wish he'd come back I get back to how life was cos I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole.
PS0CG|No no.
PS0CR|Absolutely not for anything Oh life begins again and as I say I'm only forty two it isn't that.
PS0CG|Oh crikey no you're just beginning love.
PS0CR|And erm I'm sure after this.
PS0CG|I'd I'd I'd got a four year old toddler and a and a eighteen month old crawler when when I was your age.
PS0CR|Really.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CR|Good lord.
PS0CG|Yes so life had started again for me.
PS0CR|The bally down bally down.
PS0CG|Except that except that of course I was doing everything for everybody.
PS0CR|Yes.
PS0CG|No help with anything that was after the emergen emergency Caesar and everything.
PS0CR|Henry come back here.
PS0CG|I'm I think I had to do a days.
PS0CR|it's lovely.
PS0CG|Don't throw it too far otherwise.
PS0CR|The longer you throw the more good boy it's so well hidden in the leaves it's exactly the same colour that's the trouble this time of year but no life is a funny thing and I find it personally very hard to believe that only two months ago I mean what is it nine weeks ago and I suddenly had an enormous view.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|and yet here you are.
PS0CG|It knocks you on your heels doesn't it.
PS0CR|absolutely.
PS0CG|I can see it it knocked you back on your heels.
PS0CR|But you find that you can do things you've never dreamt of.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|You find out who your friends are.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|And erm it's far from being the end of the world and I think in a way.
PS0CG|Partly true yes it is.
PS0CR|he's given me a life line so jolly well it happened and enjoy life.
PS0CG|Well both my daughters are married to.
PS0CR|That's what I'm going to do.
PS0CG|divorced men.
PS0CR|yes and I sometimes think that way I know with Ken's two brothers the way they behaved with wife number one and the way they are with wife number two is a different world.
PS0CG|Hello love.
KC9PSUN|How are you.
PS0CG|Fine.
PS0CR|Are you.

PS0CR|Oh it's horrendous isn't it.
PS0CG|an injection and been back for a check up yes it's a good thirty pounds you can't step in the door really without twenty five pounds.
PS0CR|No yes I think it's.
PS0CG|Even for their injections every year you know and the their worming twice a year.
PS0CR|I can understand if they take time on a stray dog I often wondered if they realise.
PS0CG|He was he was in the rescue.
PS0CR|what they're walking into.
KC9PSUN|Yeah.
PS0CR|the pet rules were saying whether it's a pedigree.
PS0CG|Oh well I've it because I've had two pedigree's.

PS0CG|I think they were only talking.
PS0CR|Oh oh thank you very much dog good think I'm in my dog walker's.
PS0CG|And it was a white sweater clean white sweater.
PS0CR|it's an oldy.
PS0CG|I put on my old trouser's and welly boots this morning it said it was going to be so messy.
PS0CR|Well I thought of my wellies and I thought I was just worried about falling of the pebbles mind you safe as these.
PS0CG|I can only wear short ones otherwise they catch on the back of the driving seat and I don't like that.
PS0CR|It's horrible.
PS0CG|Anything that makes me im impedes me yes.
PS0CR|normal progress.
PS0CG|Yes just happened at the wrong time.
PS0CR|Well this week I have to fly up to Liverpool on the early morning shuttle.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|on Thursday we go on a book buying expedition every year June and me we choose a lot of books of but it's a lot more fun to go and actually pick the things off the shelve.
PS0CG|Oh lovely.
PS0CR|and there's a library supplier advertised to a box shop up in Lytham Saint Anne's.
PS0CG|So it's all paid for.
PS0CR|oh yes shuttle.
PS0CG|Ah.
PS0CR|oh you'll love it on the shuttle with the representative of Midlands the firm get's us the other end and drives up to we spend all day hacking around.
PS0CG|on the shelves there I didn't know they had a big library.
PS0CR|Oh yes it's a three million books it's called Help Jackson it's one of the very very old and that I literally.
PS0CG|Oh so the public is nothing.
PS0CR|three million books on the shelve and we don't have time going properly at the price so we go anything you want bung it on the trolley and soon as the trolleys full it's taken away and another one given and you poke around and then in the evening you stay in a hotel overnight and then the following morning they get and you just sort of send up the money and they just shout up the money as we go then every time I get to a thousand they say one two and you say right tell me when I get near three and I've got this erm I'm dreadful at maths I failed maths O Level three times and I don't think about prices I've never been more than fifteen pounds out.
PS0CG|Carry a computer.
PS0CR|I can't you haven't got time.
PS0CG|No.
PS0CR|I've never been more than fifteen pounds out at the end of the day which is unbelievable.
PS0CG|Well very good.
PS0CR|It's just somewhere.
PS0CG|This is what the Government pay for.
PS0CR|This is all for provided for Broadmoor.
PS0CG|For the for the inmates of Broadmoor.
PS0CR|Yeah oh yes.
PS0CG|They have a a life of Riley don't they.
PS0CR|Well the trouble is that they've got a closed.
PS0CG|Think about it.
PS0CR|population whereas in a public library there are people using the some of for life so therefore you can't even send year in and year out they have to constantly changing.
PS0CG|Huh you have more sympathy for them than I do.
PS0CR|aha ha.
PS0CG|My first sympathy is with the people that they're in there because of if you see what I mean Hello love I mean if they if they were in cells without any books to read or televisions to watch I wouldn't have that much sympathy my sympathy is with the little girls.
PS0CR|Yes.
PS0CG|who've been left.
PS0CR|Oh yes I can understand that but it's in the same way as.
PS0CG|assaulted in bushes.
PS0CR|you don't hate someone because they have to.
PS0CG|oh no I don't hate them.
PS0CR|you don't hate someone cos they have Leukaemia you can't really hate someone.
PS0CG|Oh no.
PS0CR|who has schizophrenia they're they're because they've.
PS0CG|no.
PS0CR|done something because of the illness.
PS0CG|I feel sorry for them there but for the grace of god does anyone of us.
PS0CG|If they're sick in their heads if they're sick in their heads and they have to rape little girls.
PS0CR|Mm.
PS0CG|But my first thought is for the little girls.
PS0CR|Oh yes I.
PS0CG|and I would stick a needle in their bottom while they were fast asleep so they didn't wake up any more just like you would with an animal that does that.
PS0CR|Mm it's very easy to think that until you know them as people I must admit there are.
PS0CG|Yes I can see your point.
PS0CR|there is a hardcore see it's not necessarily what they've done but when you meet them there's something instinctively repulsive about them.
PS0CG|yes.
PS0CR|and not in not necessarily the most seriousness something the way they look at you.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CR|that to me is a hundred per cent unacceptable.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|and you just think yuck.
PS0CR|and you have to try and cover over you can't say god you're vile aren't you but erm.
PS0CG|Well I remember so I used to talk to the nurses quite a lot when I walked Roxanna my other German shepherd in Wellington.
PS0CR|Yes.
PS0CG|and quite a lot of the nurses used to walk their nurses I mean they're er war trained and unarmed combat and they're wardens let's face it they're not nurses and one of them was saying to me oh we had a fellow in the other day he'd he'd a fallen up the police stations steps I think erm he said that he'd been to see the do gooders he had this interview.
PS0CR|Mm.
PS0CG|and he convinced them he didn't need an operation he was he was cured he'd had his treatment psy psychiatrist that seen him and he was all right thank you he said and they're so clever they can convince anybody on the outside.
PS0CR|Oh yes yes Yes we ask a psychopath now why.
PS0CG|Exactly and as they took him back to his room not his cell but his room he turned to my my mate who was with me and said er I don't want an operation I like having sex with little girls he said now I've got two little girls and I had to turn and walk away.
PS0CR|mm.
PS0CG|I said I can understand he said I had to turn and walk away because my fingers were itching.
PS0CR|Yes I find it a lot easier actually not to know what they've done when you start work there you tend to come over these cases which to do.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CR|as much as anything but it's only cos you're writing a letter and you say oh hello you writing a letter to mum he says no I killed her to come here you don't put your foot in it a big way but after a while because you know nobody there is nice it really makes a lot of difference people.
PS0CR|you don't think oh here comes a rapist here's a sex offender he's a whatever just to take them as they come as people because you've got to treat them all the same anyway.
PS0CG|Yes but this fellow you see I said to him erm you had a lot to do with that fellow he'd he'd been down to collect him from someone on the South Coast as well with a police of course and I said what happened to the little girl he said oh she's been in psychiatric care care for four years.
PS0CR|oh yeah.
PS0CG|and there's no chance of her and she was shattered her her life was ruined.
PS0CR|Oh their life's can be totally wrecked I don't doubt it for a moment.
PS0CG|But I didn't have much sympathy for the man who was.
PS0CR|There there are those who it gives a going out and.
PS0CG|Who's got a cigarette ration and his television.
PS0CR|you think oh my god you know I'll put loads of money on him.
PS0CG|yeah do you remember the one two or three years ago who talked to do gooders that he was he was fine.
PS0CG|and he was let out and first within twenty four hours he'd gone down to the South Coast and killed his mother and his girl friend.
PS0CR|Yes oh yes.
PS0CG|just like that.
PS0CR|Yes there are those who.
PS0CG|I mean I would I would I'd stick a needle in their bottoms just like I would for a dog that had gone b gone bad I'd say poor creature can't help it.
PS0CR|There are some but then you see Ginny there's a girl in there.
PS0CG|I feel sorry for the victims.
PS0CR|There's a girl in there killed her daddy but whey did she kill daddy she killed daddy because.
PS0CG|Cos dad.
PS0CR|he'd raped her and abused her from.
PS0CG|yes.
PS0CR|the age of six and a half.
PS0CG|well she shouldn't be in there.
PS0CR|Who's who's the wrong one there.
PS0CG|She shouldn't be in there.
PS0CR|She needs help.
PS0CG|She shouldn't be in there.
PS0CR|Exactly but I mean I rest my case there's when you know their entire story some of them it makes you wonder who's more sinning against than sinning it's a strange affair.
PS0CG|I think she had every right to.
PS0CR|Yes so do I.
PS0CG|Just to fight.
PS0CR|But then future is hatred of men she's likely to go out and kill every other.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|man she comes across.
PS0CG|yes.
PS0CR|Your duties then is to protect the outside world and her from her health.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CR|So I mean it it's obviously a lot more sort of complicated as it seems on the outside.
KC9PSUN|take everyone individual.
PS0CR|Henry come back you silly thing.
PS0CR|Come here and sit.
PS0CG|What a lot of walk for your fuel wasn't it Can't you get your van down It's a long walk.

PS0CR|ring up the and say sorry my dog ate it.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CG|Yes oh Rocket for the first few months I had him after he was rescued and he was so protective of me because I'd given him a good home and never never hit him in the face.

PS0CG|No he goes up he puts his.
PS0CR|Is he yours.
PS0CG|no put's his paws on Keith and wags his tail and says hit me.
PS0CR|I'll take it.

PS0CR|Really.
PS0CG|Can't bear angry voices first he used to go underneath the rocking chair.
PS0CR|And hide.
PS0CG|and hide now even if Keith's arguing with the television which he would Politician he'll still go up and put his paws up on his knee wag his tail and bury his head and say hit me instead.
PS0CR|Here I am oh.
PS0CG|I'm I'm the punch bag.
PS0CR|Oh painful.
PS0CG|and I'd call him.

PS0CG|a give him a chew or a treat or something you know.
PS0CR|poor Rocket god how awful.
PS0CG|Roxanna if ever er god forbid if ever he's raised his hand Roxanna would have had him I think.
PS0CR|Though she never did with you really because that I.
PS0CG|Threatened her once or twice.
PS0CR|out the door like that I'd put them out the door just like that.
PS0CG|yes.
PS0CR|You've got to.

PS0CR|We'd love to look after her you see.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CR|I use the word love very very loosely like be honest I don't think I love you can feel the that love.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CR|is not one of the emotions.
PS0CG|I think there is sympathy erm for the people who are sick of course I can.
PS0CR|I think some some of the illness are so devastatingly terrified that you can only think thank god not to have that because it must be so frightening unlike some of these schizophrenia are hair raising.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|but there are undoubtedly.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|is the good bad and the ugly in there.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|and there are some who are on a very trip from here to jail.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|because if some of ours were in jail they'd be killed.
PS0CG|Of course.
PS0CR|Sex offenders and rape little girls hurt policeman they're not liked.
PS0CG|They always get beaten up.
PS0CR|They would never survive.
PS0CG|Yeah especially when it's their own little girl.

PS0CR|Do you know it's a most peculiar thing a number of people who said erm one of our really made me laugh a couple of Friday's ago came and said to me typical Christ he's done you a big favour hasn't he What you mean He said it's bloody wonderful you said it's taken years off you and I said thank you.
PS0CG|It has it has it has.
PS0CR|It's not all bad Ginny it really isn't and a number of women who think Christ is alarming you know.
PS0CG|Yes yeah.
PS0CR|But now.

PS0CR|Mm.
PS0CG|He's the father of my three girls.
PS0CR|Mm.
PS0CG|who's in my life.
PS0CR|Oh yes yeah.
PS0CG|and if it hadn't been for him I wouldn't have them.
PS0CR|Yes.
PS0CG|mind you I'd have somebody else's.
PS0CR|your girls are your daughters.
PS0CG|Yes but you know for years when they were growing up in their teens I was the the tennis net between him and his daughters where's she going who's she going with who's bringing her home is she wearing eye make up why's she wearing nylons and not ankle socks.
PS0CR|Oh no.
PS0CG|I was always the buffer between the two I used to say I agree with you dear I don't want her to wear nylons that's not the point all her friends are wearing nylons and she's not going to be the.
PS0CR|that's right do you want.
PS0CG|odd one out.
PS0CR|up on her own.
PS0CG|She's not going to feel the odd one out.
PS0CR|Mm.
PS0CG|It doesn't make much difference to us we're not that hard up that we can't afford.
PS0CR|So you're really getting it all along the line aren't you.
PS0CG|until they left home first of all it was I break his bloody neck taking advantage of my daughter cos they each lived with their.
PS0CR|Oh yeah.
PS0CG|boy boy friends before they married them they weren't sleep if they'd been sleeping around then I would of said something then I would of said something to them.
PS0CR|Something else oh yes yes.
PS0CG|but it was one man and they stuck to him and they they lived with them first and then they married.
PS0CR|Do you honestly in this day and age I don't think that's a really bad thing because until you're with someone all the time who knows what you'd never have got in you'd never have gone in would you.
PS0CG|Only too god if I lived with him first I would never of married him no no no way.
PS0CR|No.
PS0CG|No way if I'd known him.
PS0CG|The whole courtship was a tissue of lies you know.
PS0CR|Mm.
PS0CG|Where he lived where when he was born where he was born what his parents did.
PS0CR|Really.
PS0CG|Everything was lies.
PS0CR|Can't believe him I really don't.
PS0CG|Complete lies yeah.
PS0CR|Any way we'll continue this merry saga and put.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CR|the world's to right weekend.
PS0CG|And now I had a lovely fellow I'd grown up with in the same village the same sort of background we'd known each other since we were eleven twelve.
PS0CR|Oh dear where's he now.
PS0CG|he's still in love with me he says in eh working in Birmingham living in Bristol.
PS0CG|Phones me up now and again oh yeah I'll have you Still dreams about me.
