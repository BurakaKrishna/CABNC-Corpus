PS0CM|Yeah.
PS0CG|don't worry it's it's in the grass and she's just picked it up in the heat wave So to stop it cos she always used to clear the foxes from the top garden but er because she worried it it was about there on her patch.
PS0CM|Oh yes a niggle.
PS0CG|a bald patch yes so she had wear actually we had to cut down a plastic bucket cos she was a big dog.

PS0CG|thing.
PS0CM|I sort of popping upstairs when I'm here I'll take it off him but just now he he was walking along like.
PS0CG|Let him get used to it.
PS0CM|as though he could walk but when you came to the door here.
PS0CG|Yeah yeah he'd forgot all about it didn't he he was putting it on you see.
PS0CM|yeah yeah this is it.
PS0CG|They don't half get you at it don't they.
PS0CM|They do they they could wear you out But he's eating well going to the loo alright.
PS0CG|Good I I thought of you following him around watching what he was going to do.
PS0CM|Oh my dear I was it you sort of feel exhausted with the worry of it don't you.
PS0CG|Yes and the.
PS0CM|And the strain.
PS0CG|Of course you must of emptied his lower bowel when she did the operation.
PS0CM|Yes.
PS0CG|so there would of been nothing there for him to go for you must of been ever so worried following him around watching him.
PS0CM|I was because I I felt oh if it all comes to pieces it's all gon na bleed.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CM|but he was alright and he didn't strain cos he couldn't go.
PS0CG|Mm.
PS0CG|Was there any way he.
PS0CM|And he's eating it alright.
PS0CG|Oh good.
PS0CM|I I just put it on his dinner cos there's no way that I squirt it in his mouth I'd probably choke him.
PS0CG|Yeah yeah.
PS0CM|I just put it on his dinner and he he's licking all his bowls clean.
PS0CG|Oh good.
PS0CM|so that it's working.
PS0CG|So he's not off his food that's a good sign.
