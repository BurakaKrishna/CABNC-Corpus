PS0CG|Yes yes.
PS0CK|Red eye.
PS0CK|Ah what you doing down there ah.
PS0CK|Aha.
PS0CK|Oh I've done about four but we were having trouble with he want's some books he likes books but won't give us a clue and.
PS0CG|You could give him a book token let him do his own.
PS0CK|Well that's a good idea the thing you see the thing is she says oh we I read anything you know buy anything well I said well suppose you've already got it you know it's erm and also we offered him some some author's names so he didn't like this and he didn't want that you see so erm but in one hand he's saying buy me anything and the other hand he's saying I don't like this and I don't like that.
PS0CK|Yes yes that's right yes.
PS0CG|For a few hours.
PS0CK|Yeah Yeah you've got.
PS0CG|Do you think that's true.
PS0CK|Yeah would you but a couple of years because John was busy he bought us all tokens erm he bought the others tokens from Woolworths and me token from a body shop and we all and I we had great fun looking and seeing what we wanted to buy with with the book tokens er maybe maybe I mention it providing we can't find anything.
PS0CG|It's pleasure of going around.
PS0CK|Yeah and and looking themselves yeah The other thing he mentioned for his birthday was would you believe was a shirt with er with sleeves that you can put erm cuff links in would you believe He said I've not been able to get one and I went to he said I thought with an old.
PS0CK|Yeah quite often they do don't well they used to I don't know if they do.
PS0CK|Yes but erm.
PS0CK|No no cuff links look nice don't they And I said to Polly they must make them yeah.
PS0CG|The only thing you can do is.
PS0CK|Yeah Polly's got some nice ones yeah yeah.
PS0CK|Yeah got some nice one's.
PS0CG|I get.
PS0CK|Yeah.
PS0CK|Yes I think they're for myself.
PS0CK|Yes that's right I see but I said to him we'll try Alder's and the Army and Navy But I.
PS0CG|shirts even if they're only Marks and Sparks.
PS0CK|Yes I've got yeah I know they did but I think after a while they stopped doing that I think the latest ones you'll find don't don't do that they gave you know after a while they gave that up but I I must check on that I must check on.
PS0CG|if he wears a long sleeve shirt as soon as he takes his jacket off he won't go around with his shirt.
PS0CK|No.
PS0CG|roll his sleeves up.
PS0CK|roll his sleeves up yeah Tom's like that yes.
PS0CG|Even.
PS0CK|Yes yes well I mean that's that's if I mean if we can get him one for his birthday that get the problem of our shoulders sort of thing that's his then then he he has to take his.
PS0CG|We.
PS0CK|Yeah.
PS0CK|Yeah.
PS0CK|what can you give him a.
PS0CK|Well that's a good idea as you say erm oh I must put.
PS0CG|I mean it could be a bottle of Gin.
PS0CK|Oh he's not.
PS0CK|He was doing so well for three months.
PS0CG|When he saw the.
PS0CK|Yes.
PS0CG|and he said you're.
PS0CK|Yes that's right after three months yes and he did that.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CK|Oh and he's still he's going to do that right up to Christmas.
PS0CG|But he won't eat the meat with potatoes.
PS0CK|No.
PS0CG|the only time he has meat he has to have green salad or maybe a raw vegetable salad.
PS0CK|Yeah.
PS0CG|But I mean yeah yeah.
PS0CK|calorie and then for another meal he'll have he'll have this other stuff with a.
PS0CK|Mm.

PS0CG|oh it they showed you pictures of things coming out the squares.
KC9PSUN|Yes chip.
PS0CK|Doesn't take a chunky chop does it.
PS0CK|Well how can it because it it I think it's got to go through the thing here if you see what I mean it it the chop you'd have to push it through a little bit and then have a.
PS0CG|Yeah a blade.
PS0CK|a yeah.
PS0CG|What's that then plate oh I don't.
PS0CK|Oh that's the thing that you put behind it.
PS0CG|She could use that without putting.
PS0CK|What what what how can you stop it how how how can you.
PS0CG|Got to.
PS0CK|bigger than.
PS0CG|But I can't see any thing here Push.
PS0CK|That sliced then that is slicing nothing's got to stop them haven't they.
PS0CG|The fact that you've come to the end of the the.
PS0CK|I can't think of any thing that would be of.
KC9PSUN|It.
