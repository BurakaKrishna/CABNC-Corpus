PS0CG|No she said well she means an oven dish Still they're very nice I wish they'd got a bigger one.
PS0CJ|What size are they then.
PS0CG|Two one and a half to two pint I would think.
PS0CJ|Oh they're not very big are they.
PS0CG|And that's a water set Hello love.
PS0CK|Hello.
PS0CG|You haven't got any larger casserole dishes have you.
PS0CK|No You want the great big one.
PS0CG|Mm.
PS0CK|Yeah.
PS0CG|about a three pinter.
PS0CK|Yeah ten pound one No we do one like this in this colour Pyrex but a big one.
PS0CG|Oh that's alright But you haven't got one.
PS0CK|But no it's that one there That's the size up from that one.
PS0CG|Yeah That's what we want yes.
PS0CK|Yeah But haven't got one.
PS0CG|Oh you rotten thing.
PS0CK|Actually ask the girls and if they get them go up the warehouse next week they'll bring you one.
PS0CG|They're nice those.
PS0CK|They're ever so popular We sell a lot of them.
PS0CJ|One point five Q T it's got on there Quarts is it One point five.
PS0CG|Quarts One point five quarts.
PS0CJ|What's that in English.
PS0CG|Well one quart is two pints And a half a quart is one pint.
PS0CJ|Right.
PS0CG|That'd make it the three pints.
PS0CK|So you'd want the next one up wouldn't you That would be that one.
PS0CJ|Well it's a three or four pints she's after It's probably a four.
PS0CG|It doesn't look big enough Are you sure it says one point five quarts.
PS0CJ|Well it says it on there somewhere.
PS0CK|one point five quart.
PS0CG|Well Perhaps it's perhaps they hold more than you think they do.
PS0CJ|I don't know.
PS0CG|What do you think Dinda Should I take this one While.
PS0CJ|Erm.
PS0CG|they've still got it It's the last one.
PS0CJ|It's not chipped or anything is it.
PS0CG|No.
PS0CJ|I've got my hands full and you've got your hands full.
PS0CG|Three pint See we might not get one more in before Christmas.
PS0CK|I'll ask Gill and Maureen.
PS0CG|Mm.
PS0CK|take that but then if you if you really don't think that will hold what you want then you'll have to bring it back.
PS0CG|It's a it's a it's a Christmas present.
PS0CK|Oh I see yeah Ah.
PS0CG|Three to four pints she said.
PS0CJ|That looks yeah looking at it.
PS0CK|I think it.
PS0CG|It's quite capacious actually.
PS0CK|Yeah I think.
PS0CG|It's a nice dish.
PS0CK|Have you we haven't got a measuring jug.
PS0CG|Haven't got any what.
PS0CK|That is right isn't it One pint is.
PS0CG|Well a quart is two pints.
PS0CK|Yeah.
PS0CG|And point five of a quart is one pint That makes it three pints Why they can't put three pints on instead of one point five quarts.
PS0CK|But does she want a three to four one If she wants a three to four you got ta have the next size up.
PS0CG|Three stroke four.
PS0CJ|Well she said three or four.
PS0CK|Oh I see.
PS0CG|so obviously she was easy about the size.
PS0CJ|I think that would be ample cos usually there's only two of them.
PS0CG|There's only two of them yes.
PS0CJ|to eat anything you know.
PS0CG|yes yes True.
PS0CJ|Yeah I think we should grab it while we see it actually.
PS0CG|I think we should too It'll be half the price it is in Boot's Cookshop.
PS0CJ|Do you want me Do you want me to drop it or should you drop it.
PS0CK|I don't know.
PS0CG|Do you remember Jackie he used to be.
PS0CK|another one look.
PS0CG|Yes And that that one holds quite a lot.
PS0CJ|No No.
PS0CG|Do you remember Jackie He used to be dark haired and worked in the toy shop in Sandhurst.
PS0CJ|Yes I do.
PS0CG|Yeah I thought you would.
PS0CJ|I knew the face.
PS0CG|Used to go in for your model paints and coloured marbles.
PS0CK|That's right yeah.
PS0CJ|There you go Long time long time ago.
PS0CK|All those years I was there.
PS0CG|You haven't haven't changed You haven't changed I mean your face I knew straight out It was your hair that got me.
PS0CK|Well the grey come through and I was just sort of I thought I can't wait all those years with dark hair I had a friend who had long hair and she she let it grow right the way through And for nearly seven years she looked like an old woman of eighty.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CK|And I thought I am not gon na have that.
PS0CG|Well that's right I agree with you.
PS0CK|So I more or less had a crew cut.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CK|And er of course it's still grey now.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CK|except like this bit here which er grows.
PS0CG|I know oh yes it always grows a dark bit.
PS0CK|but that all took I think when you're older when you go grey it's it you look softer and you get away with the grey coming through on white hair.
PS0CG|Yes That's right.
PS0CK|But on dark hair I mean for years when I was young I was jet black and that was lovely.
PS0CG|Yes That's right You were.
PS0CK|I never had to touch it or nothing But when you start going grey you look so.
PS0CG|It's pepper and salt then.
PS0CK|And your skin changes I used to be right tanned skin And that that even changes as you get older.
PS0CJ|Yeah that's right.
PS0CG|Yes well I I was very fair to start with.
PS0CK|Yeah.
PS0CG|And then it began to get a bit darker Not my eyelashes and eyebrows they're silver Always silver Absolutely silver.
PS0CK|Mine are yeah dark still.
PS0CG|But my I thought no I'm not gon na go pepper and salt.
PS0CK|That's right yeah.
PS0CG|I don't mind going silver.
PS0CK|That's right.
PS0CG|This is natural silver on the temples.
PS0CK|That's right Yeah like look here you see look.
PS0CG|Yes yes you've got a silver.
PS0CK|I mean I've got I mean I don't mind this but why shouldn't you do it And my friend she looked about eighty.
PS0CG|Yes I couldn't agree with you more.
PS0CK|but she still looks old for her age.
PS0CG|Yes My best friend was your colouring and she always has a rinse It's her husband She said I don't mind going grey but but Paddy objects because he says it makes him feel old.
PS0CK|Oh But the thing is.
PS0CG|He' my colouring.
PS0CK|also as well when you're black and you touch it up black when you're old you look hard.
PS0CG|Yes They usually say go paler.
PS0CK|yeah.
PS0CG|They usually say go to chestnut rather than keep to black Mm.
PS0CK|Actually I wish I'd gone like this years ago cos you get.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CK|you know much more fun than when you.
PS0CG|You reckon I don't know cos I've never been brunette Jackie So I wouldn't know love.
PS0CK|Oh yeah I think I think it's because I I had that severe hair style I think you know I looked hard.
PS0CG|Well I was severe I had a severe style.
PS0CK|That's right You always had yours didn't you.
PS0CG|The neat pleat mm.

PS0CG|Cor look at that bas oh no it's fine.
PS0CK|She ain't got that problem yet You wait till.
PS0CG|No.
PS0CK|She's probably saying oh this is so boring this conversation but when she gets to our age that'll be the same.
PS0CG|Well well she'll just she'll just go silver She was silver when she was little so I suppose she'll go back to silver Anything else you want to look at Dinda.
