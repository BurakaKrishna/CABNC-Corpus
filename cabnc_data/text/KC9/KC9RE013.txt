KC9PSUN|I thought really done all haven't done all that much cos I was alone most of the time.
PS0CH|Mm mm.
PS0CG|The make you sort of what were doing when making another member of staff so there's a going on full time having free coffee like Dinda did much change it to be but I mean it's just there for free all day every day she's now ten penny piece in they get a card get a little pin pricked on every time they used it up to twenty they get twenty cups of coffee on its card.
PS0CG|no they loose it so of course they have to go and buy another card Every time I do the laundry I bet there's a coffee machine card in there shirt pocket there's two there this morning.
PS0CH|Oh I guess that that means that's all right when it did you coffee machine.
PS0CG|seventeen thousand pounds if he gave them a free cup of coffee.
PS0CH|Well he he he given them a free cup of coffee it'll be alright but he didn't he gave the machine took ten P pieces so he provided them with the ten P pieces to put in and then when it was full up he'd empty it out and give them all ten P pieces back.
PS0CG|So he was given them coffee.
PS0CH|So he was for it was it was a perk or something like that I I couldn't really understand what they they were getting at.
PS0CG|I couldn't understand it either.
PS0CH|I thought that was absolutely.
PS0CG|To charge him I mean somebody gets a company car.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|the tax man charges him who is who's got the use of the company car.
PS0CH|Yes yes.
PS0CG|doesn't charge the boss.
PS0CH|No that's right mm.
PS0CG|Well I think expenses I'd should imagine that's written off against it.
PS0CH|Well he he said if they if if some get a visitor in and I give them a cup of coffee well that's all right but I don't know if it's money or or like maybe maybe.
PS0CG|But it seems to me it's the person people drinking the coffee who are getting the perk therefore they should have twenty pounds a year added for free coffee providers.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|worth twenty pounds a year or whatever it is worth.
PS0CH|Well he he was saying that that the boss was the one that provided the money that the chap was.
PS0CG|So he that was definite yeah.
PS0CH|If he was given them tokens or something like that it would of been alright but I I I a couple of weeks ago.
PS0CG|Perhaps now they're not doing it then.
PS0CH|I've forgotten the details on it.
PS0CG|Well imagine what Panasonic are going to own.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|giving out those great big blocks of all getting as much as.
PS0CH|Well this this is a lot of people of er to erm.
PS0CG|Oh I.
PS0CK|he he was sort of on loan to another company.
PS0CG|Mm.
PS0CH|and they say film industry department Wakefield somewhere got John's name out of the blue so that don't know anything else about it because he's he's always been seen by you know this this other company and he got three tax eighty seven eighty eight eighty eight eighty nine ninety and one what were the estimate was twenty five thousand pounds and five thousand pounds.
PS0CG|Yes and he hadn't even earned that had he.
PS0CH|not a chance he he never even earned that much money in all his no but I mean having having had the income tax done that to you however ridiculous that it is you've got to do something about it.
PS0CG|yeah.
PS0CH|and having been sort of helping.
PS0CH|The finally he decided what he had to right back to say you know I I tell you this is how much I've earned.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CH|this is how much tax I've paid this is I mean if you go on the dole too unless you've made a note of it there is no record of how much you've been paid on the dole they they give John the what he calls a giro takes it to the bank and cashes it and there is no no record of and when he's been on the dole I mean he's got plenty of every single bit of papers that they're given all the time.
PS0CG|Yeah but the D S S must have it.
PS0CH|Well I I don't know how keen they are on giving them out just.
PS0CH|Actually it was lucky for us because when John rang up the.
PS0CG|For his firm.
PS0CH|for his firm erm he said I'll I will see to it which she's doing at the moment but but erm I don't know how far.
PS0CG|At least it's got an end now with the others if he's on the film company he's got an end now hasn't he now he's got.
PS0CH|Yes I suppose so but I feel sorry for Simon cos you see John and Geoff they can both go on the dole but Simon's is The or or anything so at the moment.
PS0CH|Any way the thing is erm I hope only have a.
PS0CH|What he's he's earns er pay tax on everything he's earned.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CH|never had a not for all the things.
PS0CG|No no.
PS0CH|and er he's been on the dole admittedly he did go on the dole If you're on the dole for part of the year your own salary is do they add your dole money to the salary charge you tax on that.
PS0CG|Oh yes oh not half.
PS0CH|you see so I think.
PS0CG|not half.
PS0CH|I said to Paddy I think that they do that John will owe owe them some money cos he'll owe them tax from all the doles.
PS0CG|he can't tell them how much it is.
PS0CH|Because er I don't know whether.
PS0CG|Oh well that signature for it every time and it goes on his file every one has a file.
PS0CH|Well I hope so because he's been when he went.
PS0CG|Huh He didn't get very much.
PS0CH|So I I don't think it's finished yet somehow he don't seemed worried about it.
PS0CG|It seems that they chase somebody like John who at the outside may end up after five years owing them perhaps a hundred to two hundred pounds.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|and yet people like the Maxwell board.
PS0CH|Yeah yeah.
PS0CG|millions involved and other people who are running dodgy companies.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|going bankrupt and then starting up another company in another name.
PS0CH|Mm mm.
PS0CG|which I don't think should be allowed go right themselves off and leave lots of people that they owe money to and can't get it they get threatened.
PS0CH|That's right and then they go and start again.
PS0CG|in the or something it's some of them are all over again start them off of course.
PS0CH|that everybody without jobs.
PS0CG|Oh the people that took over the.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|Ever such a charming family green grocers nice enough people they have next door.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|he said and I got on very well with them have a chat and I used to help them when they came in they were West Indians which gave everybody a bit of a shock when running a local Spa.
PS0CH|Yes.
PS0CG|but erm and I notice that quite often the shelves would be half empty came here I would stop on the way back from the school the bank and the butcher's and the paper shop over the road I could come in quarter to nine and I'm you know I I was done and I said to my Arnold they're not going to sell much unless they put some money into filling the shelves surely Spa will back them and he said I keep on telling them that I keep on saying to them if you don't put the goods there on display people are going to go over the road to Lipton's and and.
PS0CH|Mm mm.
PS0CG|eventually they went bankrupt Florrie is an of mine she used to work there part time and she always enjoyed it she's been there say twenty years she just came back from holiday and found the place is closed down and none of for the past er fifteen months he'd been there that past fifteen months none of their part time staff had their stamps put on their cards so for their for their pension.
PS0CH|yeah.
PS0CG|they've they've got to put their National National Ins Insurance stamps erm none of the Tax that they'd stopped from their wages had been paid to the tax man so apparently there was I don't see how they've already paid their employer.
PS0CH|they.
PS0CG|it was P A Y E not.
PS0CG|Yeah but people can do it even in a little way.
PS0CH|Yeah.
PS0CG|little local people part time housewifes earn a bit extra to pay their mortgage or save up to go on holiday.
PS0CH|Yes.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CG|Not very fair is it.
PS0CH|No it's not.
PS0CG|How that coffee machines any any old machine well it's a small office maybe a bigger offices have the vending machine but every office will have a machine I've usually been been senior secretary I've usually been the one in charge of the petty cash which sent out for proper coffee and the new kettle if the kettle blew it's fused and the and the tea pot and the tea bags and the I just used to write a note in the in the cash book.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|and cash back in the box of the petty cash.
PS0CH|Yes.
PS0CG|if I needed any I I used to ask my boss or phone up head office and say petty cash is getting a bit low I've used a lot of stamps last week they'd send me up a cheque and never any question of they've provided us with tea and the pint of milk I use I I'd bring it in with me or ask the.
PS0CH|I suppose that they.
PS0CG|Yes yes ten minutes office time spent in the loo mm.
PS0CH|Yeah might be strong.
PS0CG|You see the leaves in our garden imagine.
PS0CG|can't you with all those trees up the top I give up on it.
PS0CH|Ah.
PS0CG|I saw a gadget the other day that's two two plastic circles with handles on mm I think I paid about seven pounds and this was to gather up leaves and big lot of.
PS0CH|Mm mm.
PS0CG|look at it it's isn't it.
PS0CH|Mm.
PS0CG|What I'll do pay out extra for two bits of plastic.
PS0CK|that was a good idea if you can borrow next door's dustbin your own you'd narf get a lot of leaves up.
PS0CG|You would.
PS0CK|you'd carry them quite safely round the corner or whatever you want but I.
PS0CG|Most of my leaves drop down and fall in the borders.
PS0CK|soil.
PS0CG|Yes yes.
PS0CK|Every time I think about it I'm either too busy or the weather's too rotten when I'm not tired the weather's pouring with rain or bitterly cold or Did I tell you where we planted the.
