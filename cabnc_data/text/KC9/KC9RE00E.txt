PS0CG|well he should only be eight and a half I mean they told us he was three and a half when he was rescued.
PS0CJ|well we'll call him nine he must be about nine.
PS0CG|They told us three and a half but there again a lot of rescue people do cut the ages of their dog but but our our two vets agreed he was around three and a half between three and a half and four look at his teeth and his coat and his bones.
PS0CJ|His eyes.
PS0CG|Had him five years so.

PS0CG|She's very well looked after.
PS0CJ|till she was about twelve she was quite.
PS0CG|ever so bright yes they were playing and chasing sticks and.

PS0CG|Thirteen she was.
PS0CG|Actually she's not simply long coated like Roxanna was she's over coated if anything.
PS0CJ|Yeah she is very very long.
PS0CM|She is she is Very seldom you see a dog like that.

PS0CJ|Mm.
PS0CG|or Husky type dog.
PS0CM|You don't see many like that.
PS0CG|No no no she's not quite full of big boned but by Joe.
PS0CJ|they've both stopped I don't know what they're looking at.
PS0CG|They're probably listening listening for the foxes or something.
PS0CM|Heard something over there.
PS0CG|Obviously they heard something.
PS0CM|I'd have to take down the shore shore tomorrow.
PS0CG|Yeah.
PS0CM|Saves leaving them in the car probably only for about two hours I don't know if it's better leaving at home or taking with me there's.
PS0CG|Don't you don't you find he'd rat he'd much happier sitting in the car.
PS0CM|He seems to be yes.
PS0CG|Than left at home where you've gone away somewhere without him.
PS0CM|Well I don't really know cos I don't know what he's like at home you see by himself huh.
PS0CG|No exactly But my dogs have always much rather come shopping with me and sit in the.
PS0CM|It's a short time though isn't it.
PS0CG|Yes.
PS0CM|It's not very long see I say what.
PS0CG|Oh I don't know the supermarkets the best part of an hour this time of year.
PS0CM|I suppose it is.
PS0CG|But oh he's quite happy he'll curl up in the back of a car but when I come home and he goes so berserk if I've left him at home I know that he's been watching and listening and waiting for me all that time.
PS0CM|He usually sits up at the window.
PS0CG|That's right yeah.
PS0CG|but he knows where your car is you're not far away.
PS0CM|Yes that's true.
PS0CG|I think they work it out that way.

PS0CG|No no way we used to we used to I mean ancient man did.
PS0CM|oh they did yeah.
PS0CG|They navigated by the by the ley lines that's why you find monuments built up on hills so they could stand in the middle of the of nowhere and they could see a they could either feel it through their feet.
PS0CM|Yeah.
PS0CG|where the where the main lines were or they could look and see erm what do you call them those groups of trees on tops of hills they used.
PS0CM|Oh I know.
PS0CG|there's one near Shoreham.
PS0CG|Oh places like that.
PS0CM|Oh yeah.
PS0CG|They could see them and navigate by them if they haven't got the sun or the stars yeah yeah we've lost all that of course as we got what we called civilised we've lost all those old skills.
