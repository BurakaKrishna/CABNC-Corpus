PS04Y|No.
PS04U|The fifty nine pound that looked one that looked.
PS04Y|Mm mm.
PS04U|but I know it cos the other week when I had to work till half past eight for Peter he was having a dinner party and erm we went down there I had to go shopping with him he made me die cos he asked me if I'd work a bit later and I said yeah I need the money so I'll work later so er he made me die because he said in this flare up this argument when when I worked that day I mean I worked all day I had nothing to eat and I couldn't eat af you know cos of this trouble I couldn't eat after.
PS04Y|Mm.

PS04U|and er anyway he got home about half past three so we had to go down to Marks went down to Marks came back and he bought me a sandwich I said I've eaten nothing all day bought me this sandwich I was hoping to go away at six.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|and at eighto'clock I went home and anyway he went to pay me my weeks money and h he gave me an extra ten pound.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|I thought that's big of you I mean I would have charged him more anyway.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|but.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|I didn't I thought.
PS04Y|Mm mm.
PS04U|Oh well.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|he's.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|given me ten pound bonus.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|and when we were having this argument on Wednesday he said I said we what what was your reason then for not paying me for that when I was genuinely sick and he said er oh he said because I gave you such a good bonus last week I said what was that then he said erm twenty five pounds I said no you didn't.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|I said you know I did some extra hours for you.
PS04Y|Mm mm.
PS04U|oh yes he said I've worked it out those extra hours I've paid you for them but I thought you actually worked for them for nothing and I've just given you a bonus.
PS04Y|Oh good god.
PS04U|and er.
PS04Y|This man is pathologically mean.
PS04U|Well the these.
PS04Y|Pathologically mean.
PS04U|these decorators just could not believe how.
PS04Y|No.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|they were just so amazed.
PS04Y|Yeah yeah.
PS04U|Just you know th th well they just couldn't just couldn't believe that somebody could actually you know sort of react sort of in in that way.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04V|I'm saying everything's turned off at the moment alright.
PS04U|Was it.
PS04V|No he's not sure he don't think it is that h he's he's gon na cut the gas he said it's not right the er central heating pumps are well hot he said it shouldn't be like that so he to there's a little box up there he thinks it's probably this box but he's he's trying to figure out what it is up there because he's he's just such amazed at price of pieces.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04V|trying to work out exactly what's going round might have a.
PS04U|But did you tell tell him that it doesn't get that hot in the conservatory.
PS04V|No that's.
PS04U|Nothing to do with that and the radiator key.
PS04V|No can't be that no don't worry about that.
PS04U|It's a worry isn't it.
PS04Y|It is I don't know.
PS04U|I suppose even sort of with a with a plumber you know y you don't I mean I suppose they don't always know what they're looking for.
PS04Y|Well no because unless they put the system in and know exactly what it was there are so many different ways of delivering water.
PS04U|Mm the thing is the guy that used to live here was such a bloody prat.
PS04Y|Oh like Brian.
PS04U|A didn't help chap.
PS04Y|Oh oh my dear.
PS04U|And the jobs we've found.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|that that's gone wrong because he's a.
PS04Y|Quite.
PS04U|yourself chap.
PS04Y|Quite yes.
PS04U|it's just totally unbelievable.
PS04Y|Yeah well this is my this my.
PS04U|Yeah.
PS04Y|this is the story of my life now in the bathroom I have had I have had to pay a hundred pounds to Mr Butcher the plumber to put in a new shower thing because that was cheap and rough and eventually wore out should never have been put in.
PS04U|What about your leak that came through the ceiling is that cleared now.
PS04Y|Oh it's doing it again it's doing it again dear oh yes doing it again erm I had the plumber up to look at that cos I thought the plumbing was all wrong and he said no he said the plumbing is wrong the waste pipe of the en suite shower and the bath are connected and they shouldn't be they should be separate but they had been connected and that is bad but no he said what's happening is quite simple he said erm the people using the en suite can't control the water it's going out he said the curtain doesn't fit flush against the wall because the wall leans you know.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and he said water is getting out he said tell people to be more careful and put towels all round so in my lovely en suite I've got old towels all round my surround.
PS04U|Oh.
PS04Y|I love that.
PS04U|God.
PS04Y|Brenda I adore it it's me all over so the bathroom I had endless trouble as you know with Shirley I had to buy stuff and Shirley came in and I gave her little presents of this and that and helped her with cooking meals for her she practically my bath tiles and my en suite tiles because we thought water was going through the wall and it was and then I had to replace the where you take the plug out in the bath I forget what you call that the trap.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|all that has had to be replaced because that was starting to drip down into the hall again And then I had to th the shower just came you know came to pieces in our hand as it were it was not working as a shower so a plumber had to come Mr Butcher came into me.
PS04Y|unscrewed the whole lot and he said this is cheap old rubbish It's continental and is not is not U K and that was a hundred pounds more or less for his fee and and buying a and buying at a discount through somebody who I knew buying this new shower and the tappy things you know.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|the mixer things that's the bathroom And the next thing that's going wrong in the bathroom will be that I'll have to replace that central heating pump.
PS04U|Is that going wrong then.
PS04Y|It's it makes an awful noise in the morning I I've got a bill to come in from the electrician for his charge he diagnosed that it's was not an electrical fault and then thought it was an electrical fault by the noise it was making a fizzing noise but he doesn't th he said it's it's the pump the pump is on the way out it needs replacing house is built in nineteen eighty five So the bedrooms and they're not too bad because he hasn't been able to do anything in the bedrooms the bedrooms are alright except that over the lintels in most of the bedrooms the plaster is is not right it's it's flaking in great lumps and rippling and cracked something to do with the.
PS04U|So was he the guy that did everything himself then.
PS04Y|Yes and he hadn't the faintest idea of how to do it.
PS04U|But that flakiness and that is obviously when it was new he didn't let it dry out he just painted.
PS04Y|Quite.
PS04U|over it.
PS04Y|That's right so you then go into the en suite room well I can not tell you the trouble I've had from the en suite Water pouring through into the kitchen water pouring down the electric wire of the lamp in the study.
PS04U|What from there.
PS04Y|Yes and eventually Shirley and I thought well I mean we spent weeks grouting we grouted and we grouted and still water was coming through and we grouted and at last it seemed to be dry and the man came and did the on the insurance and I had wa new wallpaper put up for which I paid extra because he only allowed eight pounds a roll the insurance company only pays eight pounds a roll and I had eleven pound wallpaper and a border and having got the whole thing up the s the patches have appeared again.
PS04U|And they won't pay out again will they.
PS04Y|Oh no er and I.
PS04U|Did they come and check it first or they just.
PS04Y|No no they just take your word for it and now I have got as I said I've got that I've got to paint that over and reseal and I've got to make sure that nobody makes a mess in there but the plumber said what you really need to do is to get rid of this cheap and tatty horrible plastic tray which doesn't come right to the edge of the tiles.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and buy a screen five hundred pounds he says.
PS04U|Mm very clever isn't he.
PS04Y|I just looked at the man I thought I oh god I can't cope with this.
PS04U|So you've just got a curtain round it.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|So you come down the stairs and you come into the kitchen in the kitchen we start with the refrigerator being put next to the cooker.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and I've had that taken out because I couldn't I just could not stand it especially in hot weather.
PS04U|You've got a new cooker haven't you.
PS04Y|I've got a a a well I got a new cooker had a have a new cooker because when they took the old one out it was already in seven separate pieces.
PS04U|Those bloody useless one though.
PS04Y|He bought it off the town dump so new freezer in the cu which is now in the corner bought it from Doug.
PS04U|Oh I've seen that.
PS04Y|you know reduced price but money new cooker gas hob removed because that was going U S and an electric hob put in the formica in the kitchen if you remember when you first saw me it was tiles it wasn't formica it was ghastly tiles and when Ned lifted all that out it was black with with rotten mould.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|The man hadn't grouted the tiles in properly he'd used some sort of rough old cement and the water was just going through and staying there.
PS04U|Oh my God.
PS04Y|Fortunately Ned gave me that pink formica and the new sink as a present.
PS04U|So you didn't to buy it.
PS04Y|Ha what else have we got.
PS04U|Gas fire.
PS04Y|The gas fire I have formed a really deep and meaningful relationship with Andy at Anglia Gas he's been back and forth to my house I know all about the fact that he hasn't got a girlfriend and his mother is a marvellous cook and that Worlingworth is a bit off the map he and I are buddies dear I hate to think how much money I have paid over to Anglia Gas if I'd known what I was into I could have walked into that house then and I could while I had all that money before I gave any away I could have said right I'm going to have to spend that that that that and that and I would have done it and it would have I would've been alright because I wouldn't have had things going wrong.
PS04U|Is it still working now the fire.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|But after about three hundred quid in n it.
PS04Y|Ha I could have had a lovely new one.
PS04U|That's th the trouble is they keep repairing they don't tell you this do they I mean.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|they could have sort of said look.
PS04Y|In the end I bullied Andy I said Andy there is something fishy about this fire he said well it's possible he said that it was erm a display model and every time anybody came in and needed a replacement part instead of sending for the part they took it out of the display model.
PS04U|God what was that bloke Was he a youngster or what was he that lived in your house.
PS04Y|Well youngish he'd got youngish children you know.
PS04U|Blooming idiot weren't he.
PS04Y|Well totally I mean next time I buy a house I shall say excuse me but are you a blooming idiot.
PS04U|Are you gon na be but these D A Y D I Y.
PS04Y|Oh.
PS04U|are okay if they know what they're doing but I mean th this this guy I mean.
PS04Y|My lovely Gerald was very very clever he was a mechanic he was a graduate mechanical engineer and he knew everything about cars that needed to be known.
PS04U|Mhm.
PS04Y|And he thought as a result that he knew about everything else as well and Brenda he didn't.
PS04U|No.
PS04Y|Because another way in which I had to throw good money after bad was that after he died once I started having things done in the house they kept on turning up things that he had done that were absolutely N B G.
PS04Y|the al do you remember those wires hanging about in.
PS04U|Yeah.
PS04Y|the kitchen The electrician turned quite white when he saw them.
PS04U|I know that was you but y you don't I mean I remember u the fire we used to have here and it wasn't till I gave it to a friend I mean we kept here for a year alright lucky enough we didn't use it anyway I gave to a friend who doing car boot I found it in the attic an he said to me Brenda he said did you ever use this fire He said well obviously you didn't he said cos you'd be dead I said why I He said how are y he said the wiring on this he said if you plug this in he said ho you'd electrocute yourself.
PS04Y|I say.
PS04U|I said you're joking and I said they sell the house to you.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|you know and you.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|plug it in and they.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|obviously just left it luckily.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|enough we did.
PS04Y|I'm going to ask some very very straightforward questions when I buy the next house.
PS04U|Well.
PS04Y|and I'm going to write down the answers they give me and get them to sign them because I have I have really been beaten about the head by this.
PS04U|Well it's I mean you know it's I I don't think I could live with the conscience if I was selling I would say well look.
PS04Y|No I couldn't I mean and these people are Jehovah Witnesses who sold me this house and my feelings about the commercial probity of Jehovah Witnesses are that they haven't any commercial probity.
PS04Y|They're they're probably so wrapped up in their devotion that they don't bother about standard commercial morality it was sh a shocking thing to do I mean if I were to sell my house now supposing somebody came galloping in along before Christmas ooh ooh I want the house on the first of Feb and they'd come and they'd see the house and they say yes I want it want it want it and it was plain that they were going to want it and we started to talk money as soon as we'd got the solid block of money I want one O two you er estate agent tells me I can get ninety seven between ninety five and ninety seven say they offer me ninety six.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|say we'd be you know be fiddle around and get to ninety six I would then turn and say to them I will give you five hundred pounds I will knock five hundred off that so that you can put in a proper shower tray and screen.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|put in by.
PS04U|That's it.
PS04Y|by Mick of Debenham because I understand from him that that is what's needed.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|I just would not.
PS04U|But even if you didn't sell I mean but death trap things electrical things I mean you would.
PS04Y|Quite.
PS04U|sort of feel you know I mean I've known people where I mean it was like us the day we moved in here.
PS04Y|Your conscio as you say.
PS04U|went to bed that night and thought gas you know and the blooming boiler lucky it didn't blow up I mean it had all it had gone You know I mean the next day we had the gas man out.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|and said we you know we we lucky we weren't gassed.
PS04Y|Oh Brenda Brenda.
PS04U|You know I mean people are so sort of un un trustworthy and.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|well they're just not honest are they.
PS04Y|No no they're not.
PS04U|You know I mean alright y you wan na sell your house and everything but I mean for goodness sake I mean.
PS04Y|You've got to live with yourself.
PS04U|That's right I mean.
PS04Y|What I have said to Neil and Neil is honest but once or twice he's said things and I've said no Neil No that's wrong There it's better to be it's only poor and have your self respect.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|than to try to take a mean and petty advantage of anybody or anything.
PS04U|That's right.
PS04Y|He's only said these things sort of trying out to see because he doesn't he doesn't know if very much oh it's so sad Brenda he said to me we were talking on Wednesday night I think and he looked wistfully at me and he said I only want to be taught.
PS04U|Ah.
PS04Y|I only want to be taught.
PS04U|So he's just like a child isn't he.
PS04Y|Well he is I say that he's six he's twenty going on sixteen.
PS04U|Th doesn't the doesn't the stepfather sort of say anything.
PS04Y|No what what does what do modern men think about Brenda you tell me your Dave.
PS04U|isn't it.
PS04Y|is a one in a thousand one in a thousand like my my Gerald that thought about his duties his responsibilities his tender fatherly fig.
