PS04X|Why But what did you think I'd get.
PS04U|I thought you'd get highly commended or honours What's that.
PS04X|A calculator.
PS04U|Oh.
PS04X|Dad gave me that ages ago didn't he.
PS04U|Dad did Nice one.
PS04X|Dad got that better one from.

PS04U|That's why she phoned you up All the ones that she'd got that got low like Hannah and all that she's phoned up first In case the o other ones they're sort of nasty to them.
PS04X|Jenny's been nasty to me.
PS04U|she won't.
PS04X|I know she won't be there but she I bet she will.
PS04U|what will she say.
PS04X|She says what do you get And I'd go highly commended and I'll go I'll go what do you get And she goes honours and I go we well done and she goes.
PS04U|What with her lips.
PS04X|Yeah.
PS04U|Yeah she will but I said to Tracey I said one day Carla will beat her and she said I know she will.
PS04X|And I'll do that.
PS04U|What.
PS04X|I'll do that.
PS04U|I mean I'm Tracey's surprised that Jenny got honours.
PS04X|So am I.
PS04U|Tracey's very surprised Cos she didn't think she would And like well I said to her I said well then Sandy would have put it down to the fact she did that bad in her ballet.
PS04X|Has to be a reason.
PS04U|But it's I mean like Tracey said are you disappointed I said well no I cos I said I expected a co I think she deserved a more than a commended But I said it's always the way when you think it's a good examiner she or she she gives you bad results and when it's a bad think oh an awful examiner I mean look at that one where you got that really tough examiner and you and Jenny was the only two that got honours But I didn't that Michelle.
PS04X|Yeah and I know that but then when I get the same as Jenny she goes to Leanne if we beat her yeah She go she goes up to Leanne.
PS04U|Yeah but it's like Leanne I don't know how Leanne always gets it must be the fact she's slim But Tracey said they obvious this examiner has obviously looked.
PS04X|Got any scissors.
PS04U|for slim people Which is wrong.
PS04X|But that's not very nice though is it.
PS04U|No But that's what Tracey said That's what happened with her She went in with sl slim girls and they all fa fail passed and Tracey failed Because Tracey was.
PS04X|But that's not a very nice thing to do though Because as they shouldn't fail you if you're fat I'm not exactly fat.
PS04U|No you're not fat.
PS04X|It's just that I'm big build.
PS04U|That's right.
PS04X|Mum can I have one of these Can I use one of these.
PS04U|What is it No they're yours aren't they Where's your toys Upstairs.
PS04X|Du n no Oh back.
PS04X|Look at this Nineteen eighty six Oh.
PS04U|But she said you know and what annoyed her really she kno she knows how much how hard you've worked for this exam.
PS04X|I know I tried to do it really well because it was my last grade.
PS04U|But she but she even said to me while you was in there she said Carla's got the advantage of the fact that she's so good at.
PS04X|But that's not the point really.
PS04U|No but yeah but the thing is Carla be honest with you if you'd got honours again I mean you imagine I mean thing is I'm happy for you for what you've done You've done well to get that It's like Jennifer you've got to look at it she's got ta keep up now all the time honours You've got honours for your tap Yes y I think you'd be more disappointed if you if you'd taken the tap this time and you'd come out with a commended But Tracey just very cross with her marks It don't look good on her does it Only just passes This last results she only got one pass.
PS04X|I won't get the award will I.
PS04U|No But award anyway medal Junior tap yeah but you'll get the junior tap.
PS04X|Got the junior tap and the senior tap.
PS04U|Yeah but you'll get that next year again.
PS04X|Why.
PS04U|Because you got honours didn't you In grade three.
PS04X|No cos junior tap was for grade three.
PS04U|Have you done grade four tap Yeah but you won't take it by July will you Or would you take it in May You take gold in May don't you But Tracey thought Lisa was good She thought she'd get a good mark She said she does stretch her body She has come on Lisa hasn't she She's better than Emma.
PS04X|Mm by a long way.
PS04U|I said what annoys me I said er but Emma and Lisa haven't even practised I said I said thing is I said last time everybody thought Carla was gon na get highly commended or honours do you remember Everybody said you were the best They all said oh you'll do it you'll get the best And you never got the award last year for it All of them got highly commended didn't they Hannah and all that lot Annabelle.
PS04X|Mm.
PS04U|And you think the drop on Hannah Grade three she got highly commended And grade four she got a pass So look at the big drop on that one Least you that's what I said to Tracey at least you haven't dropped your mark If you stay on the same mark or higher it's good.
PS04X|Don't wan na take this exam again.
