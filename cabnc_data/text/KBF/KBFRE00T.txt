PS04Y|and your instrument panel started showing that the wheels had fallen off and one wheel was on fire first thing we had to think was are the reading correct.
PS04U|Get out quick.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|That's it.
PS04Y|Ah he flew a thing called the flying coffin And you had get the two people who were at the back you have to get them out before you landed because when you when you brought the flaps up if they were still in this little bay you would squash them to death and one day his dials showed that he had in fact squashed them to death.
PS04U|Oh.
PS04Y|But he hadn't.
PS04U|He hadn't.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|Come on car don't start playing on me now when I want to get home.
PS04Y|Ooh don't at the thought of tea.
PS04U|So it's like that without I mean with Carla I mean you can't you know you just can't think when you've got ta I mean she would have been bored and she wouldn't have looked at the gifts.
PS04Y|Of course poor little child No No.
PS04U|Oh you're clever.
PS04Y|Ah ah dear me.
PS04U|I can't get out u any o another other way.
PS04Y|No oh dear Neil said yesterday he was running he was running in thr in through the hall way with karate suit or something he was muttering to himself and he said smoking a healthy dirty habit it's expensive and it shortens your life I love it.
PS04U|No it's dreadful they are give it up but I said.
PS04U|I with my nerves at the moment.
PS04Y|Oh no an it it's it's like slimming nobody should try to slim when they're feeling tense and agitated and worried about things.
PS04U|I'll go up Tescos way sure it gets busy over here dun n it though.
PS04Y|Yes well.
PS04U|I mean it's not packed though the shops weren't I mean tomorrow morning it'll be m murder there it'll be.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|people with kids see at night time.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|they don't.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|come with the kids.
PS04Y|No no I'm looking forward to coming back here in the Spring and having another go at clothes for you and me I'm going to save like mad.
PS04U|Might have won the Jean.
PS04Y|Oh I.
PS04U|in the Spring.
PS04Y|I should I should have some idea about selling the house.
PS04U|We all know sort of what's sort of happening.
PS04Y|That's right.
PS04U|Cos I mean you've got the feeling that didn't you that Neil might move on.
PS04Y|Nope I don't think he'll leave me until he marries.
PS04U|No I don't apart from getting married I don't think he'll leave you.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|I th I think though you know after a year or two if he'd moved away an if he moved out the area he would then break with his mother.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|It's the fact that's how I see it.
PS04Y|I'm seriously.
PS04U|the fact.
PS04Y|thinking.
PS04U|mother was sort up in Wisbeach.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|and I was in Surrey.
PS04Y|That's right A lot depends on what point I sell my house if I.
PS04U|What price you get.
PS04Y|Yeah if I sell at a time when there's still a recession on and you see somebody has to get my they had a visit perhaps that was somebody that actually bought a house not she not.
PS04U|She.
PS04Y|they haven't to sold the house they had a visit from a Bank Manager her preferential mortgage treatment as part of their immonuments they always have had.
PS04U|That's right.
PS04Y|the bank seems to pay the a cripplingly low salary demand that everybody dresses in in Saville Row but you could buy a house on a something like two and half percent mortgage well it's not like that now but it's still still get a preferential mortgage and this banking person man was looking around only three or four weeks ago but you see a lot depends on your luck as to whether you pick up a a very good buyer.
PS04U|Is your friends have they had anybody look at theirs yet.
PS04Y|They had a couple of people round but no no nibbles or I think yes I think somebody a silly offer because of course all the property pages and places like that Daily Telegraph are urging everybody go on put in an offer for a house put in a silly offer.
PS04U|Yeah.
PS04Y|Which is all very well but nobody's phoning in to accept a silly offer.
PS04U|That's right.
PS04Y|This is why at the moment I'm being a bit cautious about remaining in my cavity I don't want to find myself in the situation that I'm held to sell.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|That's why I'm so keen I shall I tell you what my plan is at the moment but as soon as the the uncourteous Bill has decided to move into his new house new flat rather I am going to take my ensuite back.
PS04Y|yeah I'm going to go back into my bedroom and Neil can still use the ensuite shower cos he's got the tip of the idea that he's got to come in clothed and knock on the door cos last time I was in my bedroom he asked if he could use the shower situation he'd you know and I'd let him after all it's not as though my be there's a door between my bedroom and the.
PS04U|Shower that's right.
PS04Y|the ensuite and er and then I will have three lodgers I will have Neil.
PS04U|Mind you Neil's not worried about parading around with nothing on is he.
PS04Y|Oh well I made him worry.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|my goodness I have.
PS04U|Don't you like his new dressing gown he was in.
PS04Y|Love that.
PS04U|last time.
PS04Y|yes.
PS04U|What was he like when you took cos you took the boxer shorts.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|dressing gown and some.
PS04Y|all.
PS04U|silly bits oh no sweets biscuits.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|was it.
PS04Y|some money you spent on me ooh.
PS04U|I bet he was like a big child was he.
PS04Y|Yes of course he is he is a poor child I hate to think what Christmas is like for some people.
PS04U|Do you think she'll buy him something.
PS04Y|I have no doubt wha did I not tell you about the fact that I hit the roof when he said that she has said that when he was twenty one she was going to buy him a Vauxhall Chevette.
PS04U|Sh she's going to.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|Well why didn't she pay for his lessons then.
PS04Y|Well that's I say.
PS04U|that's when he wanted help.
PS04Y|I said it's sh I said I he said don't you think it's a nice gesture I think that is showing off I said I.
PS04U|How he's supposed to tax and insure it and run it have said.
PS04Y|Well that's I said that's what I said an and I said where's she going to where are we going to put it.
PS04U|Just because you've passed your test doesn't mean.
PS04Y|Oh I.
PS04U|I mean it's years normally before someone can get a car.
PS04Y|You can tell what sort of a.
PS04U|You can use.
PS04Y|fool the woman is She is dreadful Does it strike an answering chord with your mother.
PS04Y|I have no doubt that if they owned their council house they would now be very busily selling and buying and selling and buying.
PS04U|She's sh she's a bitch she's a oh has she still got that horse.
PS04Y|Oh I have no doubt of course I never I despise the woman so heartily that I never ask any questions about it.
PS04U|How does Neil get on with y Philip.
PS04Y|Very well they all three get on well together.
PS04U|Oh they do.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|I was very surprised about Tony though.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|Cos I remember you saying about he didn't really want to know did he about the ad er er.
PS04Y|Neil's boss no no he said oh I think I'll wash my hands of Neil I thought that's another one If I don't stick by Neil.
PS04U|If he was still living with you he wouldn't wash his hands of Neil would he.
PS04Y|He might have done he's very a strong mighty chap and I don't know that anything I said could have influenced him and anyway Brenda to be perfectly honest I wo I wo.
PS04Y|I wouldn't be doing it I wouldn't dare I I mean I at the moment I'm not doing anything about Neil's training because we've got coming and it's it's too soon to start stirring up the bud again.
PS04U|I think you probably could have stopped anyway.
PS04Y|Yes quite yes.
PS04U|you know wouldn't it.
PS04Y|Exactly yes we'll take a breathing space until the new year I mean Neil says that at the moment he'd be quite happy to get into a job where if he was a good worker he could progress in the job and I said an what about doing your radio repairs in the evening but he just he said yes.
PS04U|I said well was it like a part-time thing.
PS04Y|Yeah well you see you can make quite a few nice little pounds for yourself if you can say to your friends I can undercut I won't chat while you get across here if you can say to your friends I can do it cheaper than the.
PS04U|Well you can it's like.
PS04Y|standard repair.
PS04U|Dave these computer been you know up in the air for about six months and Dave said you've got ta get it repaired he said cos you know y he's got ta print out on it and everything.
PS04Y|Aha aha.
PS04U|a lot of his work is sort of rather than getting copies you just do a printout.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|and erm you know and I said Carla needs it for work anyway so Dave said I'm gon na while I'm on holiday I'm gon na do all the stupid jobs so I can take that computer in.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|and he said only cost about twenty cost about twenty five quid to get.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|repaired.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|took it in and they said well they have to send it away and Dave said yeah okay he said well it's forty nine pound before you start.
PS04Y|Oh no.
PS04U|and erm providing it's nothing sort of major and that forty nine pounds will cover but if they find anything major they're it's on top of their forty nine pounds And I said to Dave you need somebody you know like a.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|handyman or so something like Neil I mean.
PS04Y|Yes exactly.
PS04U|to fix things like that.
PS04Y|That's right.
PS04U|so that if they charge twenty quid when they start.
PS04Y|Quite.
PS04U|you know half the price.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|you know that's.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|you could make the money up.
PS04Y|Of course you can well I knew of a girl who married I wouldn't say she'd married well when she started out but her husband was enterprising e eventually got himself quite a good job at the at people who print the bank notes so so that they they started off in a prefab and they ended up with a new four bedroom bungalow with central heating at Athorpe Roding And er I lost touch with her after that but Joyce was very nice very very a down to earth cockney girl from Hockston and she said er she'd tell her sister she said I do admire my sister she said they'll never have anything other than a council house I don't suppose but she said my brother-in-law mends people's motorcycles as a side line and the money that he gets from that he gives her most of it and she buys things on hire purchase this was the days when hire purchase wasn't fearsomely expensive.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and she said my sister spends I mean we're now talking about nineteen seventy my sister spends twelve and six a week on things from for the house on the hire purchase if she ever truly runs into debt she'll save part of the cost of the thing you know and then she knows that she's always going to have to put twelve and six a week aside but she does that and buys things for the house and you see if you've got if you've got that little bit of extra coming in it's quite well it's like my lodgers Brenda if I couldn't if I couldn't get what I need from my lodgers well Neil pays me Neil's house rent which thirty pound a week.
PS04U|And that's not very.
PS04Y|No I stop.
PS04U|No.
PS04Y|when he gets another job when he gets a proper job when he's employed it'll stop.
PS04U|Oh I see.
PS04Y|But at the moment I get thirty pounds a week.
PS04U|I see so if he gets.
PS04Y|and if he gets.
PS04U|some money coming in.
PS04Y|that's right and he gets some unemployment money and I take ten pounds a week off him for his food I mean it's not enough but it'll do you know and then in dribs and drabs begrudgingly from that forty over the week once he starts to run out of money cos he's paid once a fortnight I begin to give him his karate money and here's two pounds fifty to go to the pub with Neil you know little bits.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|little bits little bits and I'll buy you your tobacco Neil nothing much but little bits of something now if he were working and could give me the full sixty that is thirty for his room and thirty for his food so that I didn't have to worry about th actually paying for him but he was paying me Paul is going to pay me fifty that's thirty pounds in I made a rule to Paul that he is going to eat thirty pounds worth of food and there are only twenty pounds in my profit and then the other rule a man called Alan this window cleaner he wants the room that I'm in at the moment.
PS04U|Oh dear.
PS04Y|because he doesn't want the ensuite he can't afford it he can't pay forty pounds a week.
PS04U|Yeah.
PS04Y|or thirty five he wants to pay as little as possible.
PS04U|What will you charge twenty five for that one.
PS04Y|Twenty five yes an and for that he can make hims he doesn't want to to really to pay me for food at all so I'm going to tell him that he can have his cups spare cups of tea and a drink of milk an and some toast.
PS04U|Just bits and pieces.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|he doesn't want main.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|meals sort of thing.
PS04Y|Or main meals no but he can have that on the twenty five he needn't give me anything extra for that.
PS04U|When's he moving in then as soon as.
PS04Y|Well he was probably actually hammering on the door now to er come and see where he's going to put his ladders he wanted er a bit of wall to put the brackets up to put his ladders but Paul said that he Paul thought you could suspend ropes from my garage roof you remember what a lot of criss-cross bracing there is.
PS04U|Have you seen what we've done in our garage.
PS04Y|No I haven't.
PS04U|We took erm just wood beams across for canoes.
PS04Y|Or if.
PS04U|might as well up there.
PS04Y|Richard put over put a lot of beams and Paul at the weekend put an immense amount of his household gear up on the roof in the garage.
PS04U|In the garage yeah that's what we did we.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|the ladder and.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|everything on the beam.
PS04Y|Yes well it's possible that er Alan may see a way to using that but he is quite ni I mean he he's got no doubts he wants to come to me he's in a divorce at the moment and the moment that the final papers are signed he's got to get out of the house he has to stay there till the last minute and then the moment that the papers are signed he must go.
PS04U|But what happens if Philip's still there.
PS04Y|Well Alan says he'll sleep on my sofa.
PS04U|On the sofa for now yeah.
PS04Y|I mean h he under he says this is you know a very nice house and he wouldn't normally expect to get a room for twenty five pounds in a house of that character.
PS04U|That's right but twenty five quid is a hundred quid a month in n it.
PS04Y|Precisely Well it's it's say I say I was doing my best as it were say that everything was going swimmingly I'd be getting a profit of thirty pounds from Neil twenty pounds from Alan because five will go on the tea and the milk and the box of Cornflakes and the toast er twenty thirty that's fifty and twenty for Paul which is seventy.
PS04U|You get thirty from Paul don't you.
PS04Y|No he's going to give me fifty because don't forget he's in a small bed and he eats thirty pounds worth of food.
PS04U|Twenty pound from that's seventy quid.
PS04Y|exactly The price is considerably better.
PS04U|Two eighty a month.
PS04Y|Exactly much much better than any pokes in the eye with a sharp stick.
PS04U|So what does it did Philip pay up on time.
PS04Y|Always excellent on that yes he's a toad in some ways but in other ways he's very good.
PS04U|What about Paul.
PS04Y|Well he hasn't got any money but when he's had it he's paid on the dot the only one.
PS04U|But hasn't he got that job still then At.
PS04Y|He's only just started.
PS04U|Oh he's just started.
PS04Y|And he has to week before he gets any money he has to work a week in arrears you know they they.
PS04U|So has he been there this week Paul.
PS04Y|Yes he's been there this week.
PS04U|Next week he'll get paid.
PS04Y|money yes.
PS04U|So from next week you start getting paid.
PS04Y|Yes and if that bloody Karen comes on the scene and wants to take him back I shall tell her if you go back Paul.
PS04U|That's it.
PS04Y|that's it I'm having no more of it I've had two lots of terrible upheavals.
PS04U|Mm he can't you know he's.
PS04Y|He mustn't.
PS04U|That's right you're gon na sort of.
PS04Y|Build a trench ha ha oh ha oh oh ha ha.
PS04U|Yeah he you can't keep on and on helping them out I mean they've got ta.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|themselves I mean.
PS04Y|Quite.
PS04U|Shan't be sorry to see Philip go will you.
PS04Y|Oh I can hardly wait I mean I I went in there yesterday I think it was or this morning erm he put wet shirts into the wardrobe admittedly with the doors open but that bedroom is not a bedroom that I like to get any dampness in at all Brenda.
PS04U|Why does he just hang it you know put in the tumble dryer or hang it in the garage.
PS04Y|Too lazy Easier to do it that way.
PS04U|Has Tony taken all his stuff out.
PS04Y|Yes he has at last.
PS04U|Is he in his house yet or is he still in that.
PS04Y|Yes and he's very very difficult to feed himself to get the food in because you know he liked to come in a half past ten and bully me to cook things for him that's why sometimes I used to run up to bed and pretend I was asleep.
PS04U|Asleep So what er so how does he cope now then.
PS04Y|Cos I thought that was a with a utmost difficulty and he has to get his little daughter on Sunday to help him to clean the place.
PS04U|She'll soon get fed up with that.
PS04Y|Well tough he's not getting my he's not getting the ensuite room I can tell you If I if I have got three lodgers and I'm getting on with them and they're they're paying me regularly for the sake of an extra twenty pounds or whatever and the annoyance from Tony coming in at ten a or there abouts and then sitting there like a stuffed frock waiting for me to leap about and put food on a plate and microwave it not doing it Brenda.
PS04U|No you shouldn't I mean you.
PS04Y|I mean I w when I was dropping dead with exhaustion one evening I said to him look Tony the there's I've cooked a chicken there's a big chicken cooling on the table and there there were red sauce potatoes gravy I said stick the lot on a plate a micro and you know film it over microwave it oh well I shan't bother to eat anything now of course he was paying me for his food.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and he was jolly well seeing whether.
PS04U|But if you'd said oh well I'll prepare what about if I prepare you oh yes well I'll have that probably if you'd got done it he'd have it because he had to help himself.
PS04Y|Oh well I th I then said oh well I'll alright I'll fling it together for you oh good can you bring it into the sitting room I very nearly brought it o.
PS04U|See don't.
PS04Y|in the sitting room and banged it over his head.
PS04U|Tell you something I'd like to pick up tonight if I see it is a blooming couple of trays.
PS04Y|You know Paul has lent me some very clean but very ugly old fashioned trays of the sort that people have in restaurants that his mother lent him and they're they're a God send.
PS04U|I tell you really I mean I used to have one and went to look.
PS04Y|beautiful trays in John Lewis's this morning I was licking my lips with desire Brenda.
PS04U|The amount of ti sometimes I feel like a bowl of soup especially with not being I felt like a bowl of soup and then.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|not wanting to sit in the conservatory.
PS04Y|It's cold.
PS04U|winter and then you know you have to sort of use a plate to.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|and Dave said why don't we.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|have a couple of trays and I know it's so easy.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|and we had a couple Mark's had them I sa but they wanted fourteen ninety nine.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|I mean they probably are quite expensive but I mean I I'm sure A and N or somewhere Debenhams or somewhere would have them.
PS04Y|Debenhams probably but the John Lewis's were excellent and some some of them were tin and I do wonder if you're eating on your lap a tin tray might be rather cold but on the other hand you let the heat from the plate through to your poor little legs.
PS04U|I never noticed that.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|All-weather pitch.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|And we had one rugby pitch.
PS04Y|Yes Is this where Jenny used to live or still lives.
PS04U|Up there by those weather boards.
PS04Y|Oh yes yes.
PS04U|What about have you heard from them lately.
PS04Y|Yes she wrote to me I'll tell you what when I get back I'll pop her letter in the post to you she seems alright.
PS04U|Who Jenny.
PS04Y|Yes they've sti they've stayed together she still mark you in the letter she does come across as a misery guts.
PS04U|They all do don't they What about have you heard any more of her cos she was having trouble with her husband wasn't she.
PS04Y|Yes she still phoned me up in the morning and at vast expense to tell me how awful everything was.
PS04U|Still bad is it.
PS04Y|Oh I phoned her back a few days later and said how are things now Oh they're alright she said.
PS04U|I expect Jenny her kids are off at school now aren't they.
PS04Y|They are and I I think the whole trouble with Jenny was that not having I mean I was alright as a sort of mum subject I wasn't the same as a bona fide mum that could be called upon in all weathers at all times to do everything.
PS04U|I don't.
PS04Y|And I think she found looking after tiny children a bit too much for her.
PS04U|Didn't like she was more the career girl wasn't she I think.
PS04Y|She should have stayed in beauty therapy she's a very gentle and she's very able.
PS04U|She's very good at it wasn't she.
PS04Y|Very good and kind and small children are cruel noisy and demanding and unless.
PS04U|That's right.
PS04Y|you've got a soul of steel a heart of steel you can't cope with the buggers.
PS04U|the bath off.
