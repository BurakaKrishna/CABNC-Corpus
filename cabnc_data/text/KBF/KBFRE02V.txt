PS04V|Lose a bit of weight.
PS04U|This is it see If if you're tiny and skinny and petite You it's like Leanne I mean she's not a as good dancer It's like Jenny like Tracey said Carla was the best at She even said apparently to the big girls on a Monday there's gon na be a lot of heads turning a lot of chat going on when Carla comes out We're looking at honours this time and she just said last night she she said that's why I phoned you she said cos I just can't believe it She said cos she was absolutely brilliant You couldn't fault her out there And even the woman in the examination the pianist she actually tells Tracey if some of them are bad or whatever And she came out and she said that Carla she said she said will get honours She said she's absolutely brilliant she said you couldn't fault her at all And Tracey said that's the only thing she can think is the fact they were tiny cos Emma and that all are tiny little skinny things and Jennifer And she said it's the fact that she's carrying the extra.
