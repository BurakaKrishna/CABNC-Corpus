PS04U|he said you know fifteen pounds a week and I said to him what about the petrol I said you know it's costing fifteen pound a week in a a least and you you're you're paying ten and he said no he said he said I think that's ample he said.
PS04Y|It isn't because I keep on going down and filling up the metro with ten pounds worth of petrol and I'm not making a a trip back and forth to work every day.

PS04U|They use a lot yeah the ch I put it in my I mean I said yesterday to him we've got the decorators in and then co they turned round and said he is meant to be a businessman and they said he can not believe they've never met tha such a penny pinching guy.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|in all our life.
PS04Y|Mm yeah yeah.
PS04U|They come in he said somebody with a house like this the money you've got the cars that got.
PS04Y|Mm mm.
PS04U|and he turned round penny pinching saying that you know why has this cost me thirty quid why can't I.
PS04Y|Ooh.
PS04U|get it for twenty.
PS04Y|Oh yes yes.
PS04U|They nearly walked out last week.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|They just honestly couldn't believe that.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|somebody could be like that.
PS04Y|But some people are appallingly mean did I tell you about that Ned being done out of six hundred pounds by an indian doctor and a her husband.
PS04U|No.
PS04Y|He put in a kitchen and he thought there was something funny about these people erm they didn't want to give him money up front for the fabric you know the woods and things and he wasn't asking the full amount anyway and he said you know a things are very tight in business and I do not want to run up any more debts if you will let me have some of cash some of the cash fo for the wood as soon as the wood's delivered I'll come and do the job it's not as though your money is going to be tied up in any way and there was a bit of a face pulling and saw this woman drop to sort of always hovering around always putting her motty in and erm when th when the job was nearly completed madam steps forward with the cries of that isn't quite right and that isn't quite right and Nev was putting hours doing nit-picking fussing about getting things absolutely perfect got it absolutely perfect but when it came to the final bill they knocked off six hundred because there was the tiniest little scratch on one of the panels.
PS04U|Oh he couldn't do anything about it.
PS04Y|No it was fi it was fixed in.
PS04U|Perhaps they're fiddling.
PS04Y|Ah.
PS04U|a bit.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|That's one way to put it anyway and he said that and he said he lost out on six hundred pounds.
PS04Y|Six hundred yes.
PS04U|Did he not sort of think to take them to court I suppose it would have cost him more in court fees.
PS04Y|Well I think he can go through the small claims court for five hundred but I suppose six hundred was just over it's probably something very crafty that they thought up between them this pair.
PS04U|It's awful isn't it.
PS04Y|T is awful I was taught as a child in catechism the labourer is worthy of his hire there are four sins that cry out to heaven for justice one of them is a oppressing the widow and orphan and the other is defrauding the labourer of his hire because the labourer is worthy of his hire that's a sin that cries to heaven for justice that's what I was taught as a child.
PS04U|I bet he was really sort of angry.
PS04Y|Oh they were they felt sick.
PS04U|But the er it's does he still see them or.
PS04Y|Oh no I mean the these were clients and they could never be friends after doing that I've come to the conclusion you can either keep your money or you can keep your friends but you're not going to do both.
PS04U|No.
PS04Y|In life.
PS04U|Right shall we make tracks.
PS04Y|Yep.
