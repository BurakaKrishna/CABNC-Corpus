PS04U|And then he goes out doesn't he Occasionally.
PS04V|That's what I mean They're gon na have a great big lump stuck on the house I mean that ten grand that's their car They could keep their house Use it as a base and travel They could shoot off on a Tuesday or something Take their time going up to Scotland You could have a week up two weeks up there You could come back do a bit more work By the time they pack up work they'll be so decrepit they won't be able to do anything.
PS04U|I think your mum'll probably retire when your dad does won't she.
PS04V|aren't they I du n no Mind you criticize and say should buy this should buy that You don't really know what sort of money they have got do you Haven't got a clue.
PS04U|Must have a fair bit thought mustn't they.
PS04V|I mean I I.
PS04U|When you think they're earn both earning a full wage No mortgage Haven't got no rates They've got the poll tax and their gas and electric and the phone bill That's all that comes out.
PS04V|They probably about twelve hundred thirteen hundred.
PS04U|got a lot of money.
PS04V|Oh I don't know.
PS04U|Well she gets how much does she get from her pension a week.
PS04V|Oh that's without the pensions That's just their wages So they get about twelve thirteen hundred And probably picking up another hundred pound hundred and twenty pound between them a week We'll say another five No they're probably they're probably clearing every month about seventeen hundred quid.
PS04U|And what have they got to pay out.
PS04V|Poll tax Food That's basically it really.
PS04U|Think they've got no mortgage And the bills aren't that high are they Think they've actually bought the T V now haven't they.

PS04U|T V and the video.
PS04V|Mind you when you think of it like that when you when you say that you've got no mortgage and your kids grow up they don't need your money and that and if you're both in good jobs it is you do tend to think to yourself well at least lot lot longer than Sort of you've got your health knock out sixty seventy right we can do it for another year I mean got no mortgage to pay out you can you can bank eight hundred pound of that every month.
PS04U|Well they probably do but I mean right they can go and I mean what do they spend their money on.
PS04V|Presumably perhaps they're just saving it up until they get to a certain certain age and they're gon na say right that's it let's just go But I can't see it either.
