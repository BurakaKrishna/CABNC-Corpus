PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|My my years have caught up with me you know It's all very well keeping mentally flexible and all the rest of the but if you er my my mother stopped and said to her many years ago she said you don't look your age you don't act your age you don't sound your age you don't think your age but you are your age and this is absolutely true as you grow older nothing will stop the fact that your arteries get a little harder so that you know that you get raised blood pressure quite easily if your agitated and you are for some reason you you have to puff a lot more I was reading about this just recently and these are changes that take place whatever you do you can exercise and you can take vitamins and you can keep your weight down but you age.
PS04U|Age I'll fight it.
PS04Y|Well you can fight it I do but you don't win all hands down.
PS04V|Cos you see I've act.
PS04Y|Yes yes but erm you know I have had to say to the chaps one of them came in and he said he'd been spoiled down at the cedar and I said oh well I I've been cooking a breakfast for Neil of course by the operation of sods law Neil suddenly goes off the idea of having breakfast so I find myself cooking breakfast for this other lump who is as idol and selfish as anybody ever met in all the born days and I said to him just recently I said I I can't get up and do breakfast's in the morning any more well he says he come's down and does he's own you see they can when they feel that they want too.
PS04V|Yeah especially when it's cold and dark you don't want it you can have an extra half hour in bed.
PS04Y|Well it's it's simple that if I got up at half past six and took him up a cup of tea at quarter too seven and when he was around at seveno'clock I was grilling bacon and I was frying eggs and I hope I don't know whether perhaps it's my cold but I I just used to feel terribly unwell after he'd gone for about two hours and my legs were so wobbly I was sitting down on the sofa I may go back yet to cooking him breakfast if I feel like it but the I mean if I can say to these chaps that there are times when I don't feel like doing things well I reckon Dave that they are so glad to be in that house with the central heating with the twenty four hour er er a day water and the comfort there not going to argue.
PS04V|Yeah that's right.
