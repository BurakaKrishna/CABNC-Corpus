PS04V|He seemed alright didn't he.
PS04U|Yeah.
PS04V|The only thing I was him with his poxy trainers on and no shoes When he turns up next week his trousers'll be about three inches above his shoes.
PS04U|Might get your shoes on Wednesday.
PS04V|But make sure he's got his trousers on.
PS04U|Why does he have to have his trousers on.
PS04V|Well he has to put the suit on try it on in the shop to make sure it wear his shoes there cos even the shoes he's got might be alright with it.
PS04U|But they they've got holes in He needs new school shoes.
PS04V|Yes but if they are alright you know the type of shoes you want.
PS04U|All he's gon na wear are shoes that day.

PS04U|Are they are they quite similar to his school trousers.
PS04W|Oh yeah.

PS04V|You couldn't te they were long.
PS04W|Short.
PS04U|Eh.
PS04U|you can't tell because he had trainers on.
PS04W|Short.
PS04V|We may he measured we the leg he had trainers on And matey done them a little bit longer He added a bit He done down to the top of the trainer.
PS04U|Have they got turn-ups on.
PS04W|Yeah.
PS04V|and then down a bit more.
PS04U|they'll cut them.
PS04V|Well I should imagine they'll cut them yeah.
PS04U|They they will they won't they won't just turn them up they'll actually cut them.
PS04V|So he picked it up and he shoes I'll give you the receipt actually so you've got it in case.
PS04U|Go and get your Benolin Or the other one How many has the other one got.
PS04U|Four at a time.
PS04W|No.
PS04U|So how many ti times do you take it One spoonful or one.
PS04W|two teaspoons.
PS04V|My pension.
PS04W|Getting old mate.
PS04V|Here you are If I was to pop my clogs at work or any time you'd get fifty five thousand eight hundred eighty pounds.
PS04U|Quick knock him off then We'll knock him off quick.
PS04V|Plus you get your three and a half grand back Plus you would get five thousand six hundred and six pounds a year pension Plus the insurance on the house would pay up so you'd have ha bloody hell so you'd have about sixty grand in the bank.
PS04U|Must be worth twenty five grand then.
PS04V|No mortgage.
PS04V|Think how many shirts with that you could buy then And at the moment you know when I'm gon na retire Bren.
PS04U|When When is it.
PS04V|This ain't far away.
PS04U|With that fifty five yeah Fifty five grand What if you don't if you don't die before.
PS04V|You don't get it do you.
PS04U|You don't get it.
PS04V|I retire I'm sixty five right this is not far away.
PS04V|when you say it like this On the fourth of July two thousand and nineteen.
PS04U|Is that.
PS04V|That ain't far away is it.
PS04U|What's that At sixty five.
PS04V|Mm.
PS04U|You're sixty five in that year.
PS04V|And if I if I stayed with Tescos and got me pension and that But I don't think it's with the A VC's it's just the pension I could if I retire at sixty five I can have twenty this is the best bit twenty one thousand pound in a lump sum And then I could have a pension which would be seven thousand six hundred and seventy three pounds a year which is about a hundred and twenty pounds.
PS04U|A month.
PS04V|a week No a week Plus you would have that month's salary.
PS04U|What would you go you wouldn't have a lump sum.
PS04V|Oh yeah yeah.
PS04U|You'd have the lump sum as well.
PS04V|Oh I'd have the lump no you can it would be more than that My pension if I didn't have it if I say I don't want the lump sum the twenty one grand.
PS04U|Yeah.
PS04V|It would probably be fourteen thousand pound a year you'd work it on two hundred and fifty pound a week But if you're sixty five you haven't got much longer to go have you You know what.
PS04U|If you took the lump sum and.
PS04V|Yeah If you get your lump sum out if you want a new car you get a new car Because you get your state pension as well Which is for a couple would be eighty three pounds So you'd be on you'd have twenty one grand which you could put away.
PS04U|Live on the interest.
PS04V|No you couldn't live on the interest But see the way I the way I assume see this the endowment on the house is paid.
PS04V|So that goes fifteen thousand So you'd have like twenty well so they about twenty grand so you get twenty grand there By that time we should have about I would say at least another ten thousand pounds in that account of yours So you'd have thirty grand there which.
PS04U|And those family assurance things.
PS04V|Yeah Plus the shares which will be on my side Plus this pension so you'd be you'd have your house paid for so you'd get a nice.
PS04U|A nice nest egg.
PS04V|a nice lump you can draw for a holiday and plus have a good living between That's why that at the moment I don't see it well I don't see it a necessity you to get a pension.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04V|But I think.
PS04U|You got that family assurance thing haven't you And I've got my tessa.
PS04V|That's what I mean yeah That's why I say to you you say oh we've got this we've got that we want that we want this but er I tell you two thousand nineteen and you're at nineteen ninety two That ain't far away though And plus the fact there's I don't wan na work till I'm sixty five I wan na pack up about.
PS04U|What about that pension if you want to pack up before.
PS04V|No it's it is quite reducing That's why you've got ta be er put all your things together now See even that there If for some reason you go back there and you're not happy with the suit.
PS04V|right.
PS04U|I shall cha you know me.
PS04V|No let him try it on Don't take the suit away Alright Listening.
PS04U|Right Well what if he says well it's alright you take it away and then bring it back.
PS04V|No Well it's no good to you Alright Don't take the suit away the only thing I'm a bit dubious well he said well take the suit home and try it if it's not he said come back with it he said and we'll exchange it down here He said there's no problem with the exchange I came out that shop and I thought and why the fucking hell didn't he let us try it on there and then And if it ain't the right size he can take the one that is So I thought perhaps matey only had a small and large Not a medium so he's given him the small so he's thinking if if it doesn't fit he's still made the sale If you see what I mean So you have to go back and have another shirt I mean he had about four or five different shirts there But it has to be white.
PS04U|What did you think it would be too small.
PS04V|Well no cos matey I don't think so cos matey said he is a small Cos I said to him I said well look he likes his shirts baggy he said yeah but you can't have a shirt too baggy with a suit So.
PS04U|But that shirt's okay cos it I mean he can wear that to school can't he The rest of.
PS04V|Oh yeah But he's got ta try it on and make sure it's not if it's all tight he ain't gon na be happy in it is he That's if.
PS04U|he said today he said I don't know when I'm gon na wear the suit.
PS04V|Well you said he could wear it well like you said most people mm I'll wear it Have a night out at the.
PS04V|Have a night out at.
PS04U|What.

PS04U|At the end of her bed It's not it's not like they said.
PS04V|In n it.

PS04U|Well she can either sing in it play the organ sing in it and tape it as well You can have a lot of fun with them Can't erm like the one she's got upstairs is like all she was quite happy with is a seventy pound one Like that but a bigger version with full keys.
PS04V|Mm.
PS04U|But this one this bloke's got is a full key like a piano.
PS04V|Oh is it.
PS04U|And you've got all the tunes You've got all the you've got I think a hundred voices You've got jazz ballet all different things on it.
PS04V|Oh.
PS04U|I mean it's it's good to play Well I think that's quite I mean I'd probably knock him down to a hundred anyway I said to him if if last night I said I probably I said I want to try it out first Leave it at your house and I'll try it out and erm but Nick wouldn't sell it to you if he thought it was.
PS04V|Oh no.
PS04U|not worth it But he I mean that one from Argos seventy quid And it's not the full size keys or anything.
PS04V|What's he flogging it for.
PS04U|Been made redundant It's.
PS04V|Where did he work.
PS04U|it's er she did say It's Pete's erm Pete Nick's sister's boyfriend Du n no who it is.
PS04V|Oh well we've got the cash The money's like I said to you.
PS04U|Oh yeah but the thing is it's something it's the main it's something she it's like said to her last night.
PS04V|Well if she wants that you let her have it.
PS04U|what do you want She said I want an organ but mum would never let me have one And it's worth.
PS04V|The only thing I don't like about it is the noise.
PS04U|Ah yeah but it's not noisy noisy are they.
PS04V|Aren't they.
PS04U|And the fact what I like about it it can be battery or mains.
PS04V|Oh.
PS04U|Plug it in And I mean she's you've got room out there to have it if it just stands And then that.
PS04V|I was gon na say tell you something You That's Someone had an intruder I'm not sure but I think it was Mrs Turner.
PS04U|Well funny enough she's she's got a light to put on now.
PS04V|Yeah I see the bloke putting them up Because it was an old age woman they ain't give anyone's names old age woman was er it was in the paper sort of met up with an intruder in her house like and I du n no went screaming went crackers But then he said a neighbour who had a dress just wearing a dressing gown and he was married with three kids which is next door heard what going been going on and he they were chasing were chasing all through the common Virtually all the way out to park but they didn't give his name either.
PS04U|Must be her.
PS04V|That's what I thought when I see her put her lights up.
PS04U|I didn't see I just saw them lit up last all last night lit up.
PS04V|Yeah Yeah I just assumed I thought oh hallo I was reading it in the paper I thought oh I wonder if is.
PS04U|And she had that paint didn't she That iffy painter.
PS04V|Mm.
PS04U|Trouble is they know she lives there on her own.
PS04V|Mm That's what I mean We don't wan na put a lot of valuable stuff out here Cos at any time I mean if we're here I mean there's always someone in cos I'm working nights so I'm here in the days So easy to break that.
PS04U|I'm glad I've got broke the back of it All I've got now is I haven't got ta go out for a main if I'm out just pick up a couple of bits for him when from Woking But I can go to Woking and get whatever.
PS04V|Yeah.
PS04U|And that's like Carla I might what you got from Argos the other day I might keep one of the things back for her birthday.
PS04V|Trouble is if they get so much they don't use it I mean it's different if it's clothes they need good.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04V|But if it's toys They get all the toys and they.
PS04U|She needs She's got nothing up there what we brought Alright that but nothing one game she can actually play with It's like Lee I mean he'll have all his stuff and that he's got nothing to do.
PS04V|hasn't he.
PS04U|But she does still.
PS04V|Mm.
PS04U|God that'd be a nightmare She's got fifty presents to buy.
PS04V|Where she going for Christmas then.
PS04U|Well if Vicky's in hospital she said they're going for the day there.
PS04V|Are they But if how does.
PS04U|she's not well enough But I mean I think Gill sort of worries the fact I think she's I mean nobody said she'd be in there till Christmas The doctor just said.
PS04V|No well if she's eating they aren't going to let her out.
PS04U|Well she's down to six stone eleven She was nine four before this started No she's lost four stone she was ten stone four And then she's been average on the last three or four months she's been on eight stone But now it's gone down but there's no ulcer she had a laparotomy on Friday the tube And there's nothing wrong with her it was just sort of it's just nerves isn't it Strain and nerves.
PS04V|I keep thinking I mean I can when I first met her She I mean she's got all the facilities about her but she don't seem.
PS04U|She's ever so I mean she's very quiet and sort of sweet but she's got no.
PS04V|Got no idea.
PS04U|I mean I said to her today I mean there was this costume there and I said here get that one there I said french maid outfit nurse's outfit I said get that then And she went no I wouldn't wear that I said oh Dave would like that There was no you know no no sort of sense of humour there at all But erm you know I've I've but she said he's been right sort of.
PS04V|Well you would be wouldn't you Tying all that money up in the house Now if he's got ta make out himself there'll be a possibility he might be losing it.
PS04U|But you don't know how bad he is I mean he wouldn't sack his ex wife She still works with him in the shop And Gill gave her job to go and work in the shop and he wouldn't let her go and work in it I said I thought it was you She said no he kept saying oh we'll start you in a month start you in a month if I get rid of her And he wouldn't get rid of her And that's where a lot of it and she still think's that he's.
PS04U|Yeah I mean he was married for quite a long time to her apparently And she only lives two doors from the shop Goes round there for his lunch.
PS04V|Does he.
PS04U|Yeah I mean you know he's made the break And she said he's just so you know.
PS04V|it was one beer and that was it I couldn't believe.
PS04U|Yeah.
PS04V|how come you're back in.
PS04U|It's just different people aren't they Just sort of a bit.
PS04V|Oh well so all we've really got ta do now then is just get out and do a shop for Christmas We ain't gon na be doing a lot anyway are we.
PS04U|I've got all that.
PS04V|Yeah all we want is a turkey.
PS04U|Bit of turkey and some drink Get a few nibbles sort of like couple of days before like er cos if Kim comes I'll do like I did last year just a little buffet tea But I'm not buying biscuits and sweets and.
PS04V|Gateaux.

PS04V|Mm.
PS04U|There's nothing really And a couple of bottles of wine.
PS04U|No.
PS04U|And that's it So it hasn't really I mean today I've I paid all this cash.
PS04V|Just sit there in a.
PS04U|Well I just think of the fact and I know it's sort of miserable but Christmas night I think well if you've got ta sort of something like you've got to put up with your mum and dad and I think well just the more the merrier Because just sort of go for it and it's all done and then.
PS04U|visit You let them visit you on that night and that's it.
PS04V|diet and you'll end up having his dinner.
PS04U|Well we'll just say no.
PS04V|are we.
PS04U|We'll tell him We're we're not around.
PS04U|we know they're gon na be around we'll just say you know we're not gon na be around Cos we might feel when we come out there we'll look at the turkey might go for a walk or go.
PS04V|Er don't think so.
PS04U|Are the pubs open.
PS04V|Yeah I reckon the pubs open.
PS04U|Yeah Christmas.
PS04V|If you go Ten till twelve I mean if you have a good hour in there you're not gon na get in smack on ten be there about twenty past ten probably get in about twenty to eleven that's just right Get out at twelve By the time you've had an hour in there swimming you know how busy when you're swimming lengths what with the diving in You then you want to get home and get your dinner Cos it makes you hungry dun n it swimming.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04V|So you wan na have it going cos like I say turkey night before Lob everything in if you can Put it on a very low one so when you come back about twenty past two whack it up and by sort of say threeo'clock quarter past three you can sit down and eat your grub dinner Be nice if you could get it get it then if you felt like it afterwards about half past four or something you could just get out to get fresh to quick walk.
PS04U|Fresh air or something.
PS04V|That's it Walk a bit of dinner off so you can come back and sit down and I reckon Christmas is cracked up a lot more than it it's made out to be I personally think kids If it's no.
PS04U|That's what Jean was saying yesterday She said you she said when I think she said I normally pay sort of fifty sixty pound a head present she said And she said who really is bothered how much you spend on them As long as there's something.
PS04V|You open it up and you look at it and say oh thanks It's lovely.
PS04U|She said unless it like with with that doll she's bought Carla she said they're a good thing for collectors for her She said you know she them and her trolls she collects She said alright it's twenty five quid it's an expense but she said but it's something that she'll keep.
PS04V|Yeah.

PS04V|It's crazy.
PS04U|Yeah they use well mum and dad's got time oh we'll share it with the kids.

PS04V|She's going to ain't she.
PS04U|I don't know She don't know does she Cos it obviously she wouldn't be able to sell spend it down here.
PS04V|It's funny though in n it Every every year four weeks about well even before that but you always have to s every year.
PS04V|I know if we ever fall out it's always about family at Christmas All year you don't see them.

PS04V|Mm.
PS04U|Even though if Beryl wasn't sort of around Because I mean it's like you know it it's like with Jane kids I mean the fact is half her.
PS04V|If you went up there you wouldn't be you wouldn't be happy up there.
PS04U|I mean it's like Jane I mean I was thinking the other day I mean alright she we haven't phoned each other but I mean the thing is half of her she's just so naive with mother She doesn't want any up she wants to be happy with I mean Jane out of all them I mean normally I mean she's she would do anything for you You know if you sort of said to her look I need someone to have the kids for a week She wouldn't hesitate.
PS04V|Yeah But I can't see that I can't her not having for Christmas.
