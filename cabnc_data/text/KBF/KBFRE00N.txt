PS04U|Which is good cos it was just.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|just over erm er just over a stone I've lost.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|And you know it sort of.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|frightened me.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|cos of this.
PS04Y|Yes you can't afford to lose it.
PS04U|That's right and I mean you know it's like now my hair needs cutting and you know.
PS04U|you just feel I think when you've sort of lost much weight.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|and I mean you know and I always feel the blooming cold I mean I feel.
PS04Y|Oh yes.
PS04U|the cold anyway but sort of.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|I said to Dave you could feel my hip bones and it oh.
PS04Y|Ah.
PS04U|it was awful I du n no.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|you know I always said wouldn't it be lovely to be thin and I said thank God.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|for a bit of fat on you.
PS04Y|Oh absolutely.
PS04U|I said because.
PS04Y|Well I remember Jackie telling me she came back from sh she came up to meet me in London one day and she came up with the woman a German woman who at that time was a buyer for Army and Navy er women's fashions and this woman said that the model girls who are so thin she said they're always bursting into tears and crying because they're under such stress to keep their weight down and their boyfriends don't like it because the girls are are lovely to have on their arms to take out you know everybody sort of goggles you know lovely slim girl with yellow half way down her back etc but in fact these girls get very very ratty.
PS04U|Mm have you seen Jackie lately.
PS04Y|She phoned me a couple of days ago and said you know that life was really quite on top of them her mother-in-law died and they've had all the problems of putting the old man into a home the main problem.
PS04Y|being of course is first of all find your home and while he wasn't in a home he was driving the neighbours mad because he's beginning to get confused and wander about and maintain that he hasn't had his dinner when two people have already taken him in lunch you know and the other problem is erm er er having found him a very nice home he didn't want to go.
PS04U|He didn't want to go.
PS04Y|No not likely He wanted to stay in his own place but Jackie and Neville were nearly driven mad running up and down to Letchworth when all that they had to do Jackie's full time teaching and Nev is trying to build as many kitchens or build as many doors for millionaires as he possibly can.
PS04U|So how's erm young Neil.
PS04Y|Neil poor boy he had a driving lesson yesterday came home and said I don't want to do any more.
PS04U|What driving.
PS04Y|Mm so he was going to go up to.
PS04U|I bet.
PS04Y|Neil bring cup of tea in here and we'll talk about it and I didn't really want to spare the time because you could imagine that I wanted to get ready to come away but I I made myself sit and really give him time.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and he said he lacks he totally lacks confidence.
PS04U|This is what he said.
PS04Y|Yep and and he doesn't seem to be able to concentrate and I said but Neil you can drive when you go out with me you drive beautifully yes but yours is an automatic car I said it's not that I said you've got road sense you know what you're doing I said your good No I'm not I'm awful I said look Neil you can drive but let's not let's not take it that I'm saying that you must drive let's go into the question of why you're making a mess of it at this time and we oh honestly Brenda if I've got black circles under my eyes do not be surprised because of course this all goes back to his absolutely appallingly stupid mother.
PS04U|He's really on a downer isn't he.
PS04Y|He is he said my mother said she could have been a forensic scientist if it ha if I hadn't been born Well Brenda you can tell I hit the roof I mean normally I never criticize the woman because after.
PS04U|No.
PS04Y|all mothers are sacred but I just had to put the boot in on her I'm afraid I said stuff I said she could have taken a degree in her spare time in th she's only she's not yet forty I said that's absolute rubbish I said th the world is full of these damn women going around saying if only I hadn't had children I could have been Lord Chief Justice of England I said it isn't true I said an er I said do you think that I wasn't a career woman I said I gave it all up for yo er to have to look after my young babies and then when the babies were no longer young when I got through that phase of my life I went back and combined looking after a home very adequately thank you With quite a difficult job I said this is a I said your mother is living in a fantasy world of course I see the stupid bitch prancing around Stowmarket with her silly nose in the air She's a very conceited woman Pete the adulterous told me she was a very conceited woman and er Neil says I I I'd have to talk to him to him about this she couldn't discuss anything with him she would lay down the law that was how it had to be and I said no I said Gerry and I I had no hesitation as I said in putting the boot in and Brenda and Dave take the same the attitude to children that you let them first of all when they're small you have to tell them no like you do not.
PS04U|That's right.
PS04Y|put your handy in the fire dear.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|And then when they get bigger you give them more and more freedom to do just what they want to do and all you do is watch carefully and make sure they're not doing anything obviously outrageously daft but you let them find themselves and if there are problems they bring their problems to you and you sit down and you quietly talk about it there's not shouting no I say you've got to do this because I am your parent.
PS04U|That's obviously her that was her answer.
PS04Y|that's her answer yes.
PS04U|You just sort of wa you know argue it an.
PS04Y|I know and and he says too he had to admit that he's lazy.
PS04U|Who Neil.
PS04Y|Neil yeah and he said my mother is a lazy cow.
PS04U|Yeah but don't you think he he he finds I mean if alright y y you're not ex always exactly like your parents but if you've bro if he's brought up his mother's lazy.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|so I mean you know that's part of his life isn't it.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|I mean it's he won't know better.
PS04Y|This is what I said to him this is what I said to him an but he said I I see you with all your get up and go so I didn't make any reply to that.
PS04U|No.
PS04Y|I thought well let it sink in.
PS04U|That's right.
PS04Y|And I came in one day a few days ago an and running around like a bee on heat with erm cries of oh I've got so much to do and no time left in which to do it and I went ha I said yes if you got up early you know.
PS04U|That's right he cos he is very bad on timing isn't he.
PS04Y|Shocking.
PS04U|I mean like you say you ought you know you ought to buy her a talking alarm clock for Christmas.
PS04Y|Oh yes he's got to have an alarm clock.
PS04U|Or a radio one.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|so tha that would actually.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|the noise.
PS04Y|Of course I've I've left him in the charge of of not I haven't asked Paul to take him under his wing over the weekend but I've left Neil a list of things that I would like done.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|Like get back the dustbins which took them out but she didn't bring them back at the end of the drive erm and I hope that Paul tells him off.
PS04U|And make him do it do it.
PS04Y|An and you know says look Neil you've got to get your ideas together because that's what Neil has lacked he's lacked masculine influence.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|It's no good.
PS04U|now I mean you've been very to Neil over the last year or so and I mean now it's time to get his act together.
PS04Y|Oh yes.
PS04U|She can't keep on.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|I mean.
PS04Y|I mean I've stopped I've I I don't any longer get up and get anybody's breakfast for them.
PS04U|Nope but if you get you know.
PS04Y|I get out I get out of bed at eighto' clock when the last of the lodgers has gone well the last of the two lodgers.
PS04U|Mm but you can't.
PS04Y|gone.
PS04U|you know y y there's no more now I mean running around.
PS04Y|er of being unemployed the thi Neil is the third lodger of course tha who get's out of the pit at about eleveno' clock in the morning.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|But er that's from now on Neil has got to carry th the responsibility for his own actions.
PS04U|That's right.
PS04Y|I'm not going to bail him out by jumping into the car.
PS04U|And really he's got to I mean you know alright with work wise I mean he's got to take even if I mean the kids these days I mean even at Neil's age I mean you know I've come the conclusion now these kids they think the world owes them something.
PS04Y|Yes they do.
PS04U|They're not like in our day.
PS04Y|I know no.
PS04U|I mean they really think I mean it's like Lee he's doing this work experience an yes it's great an it's a bit boring mum and Dave said Lee you know wake up.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|This is reality.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|This is what people go to work in an office.
PS04Y|Quite.
PS04U|work nine to five thirty.
PS04Y|Yes yes.
PS04U|He said we I tell you what I didn't like mum an I said what He said making the tea I said tough.
PS04Y|Yes exactly.
PS04U|I said what do you think you go.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|into your I said you go into a job your earning.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|twenty five grand a year an and you're sat at that desk and you're boss I said it doesn't it work like that Lee.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|I said you're the general dogsbody.
PS04Y|Quite quite.
PS04U|He said oh God And I said we.
PS04Y|That's the way life goes.
PS04U|you know I said that is life.
PS04Y|Yeah mm.
PS04U|He said God he said I didn't realize it's like that I said no you didn't.
PS04Y|Do you do you think they get a false idea from the television or something wha what is it.
PS04U|Well I du n no I thi I think the teachers to be honest Jean no you.
PS04Y|Ah.
PS04U|know th the teachers in this I mean you know I don't know I mean so some of the teachers have got got really weird ideas.
PS04Y|Have they.
PS04U|I mean you know it it's unbelievable But.
PS04Y|Ooh I'd like to know what their weird ideas are.
PS04U|Well it's just erm ah I don't know I mean there's there's certain things I mean it it's like this maths I mean I I spoke to her erm and she said yes Lee had come on and everything in his maths and I said we the thing is I said knowing Lee has difficulty in in th l in the high level maths yes you don't want to drop him but surely I said I'm willing to help in my spare time Lee's willing to do it and I said can't you show Lee I said I'm not I wasn't trying to tell her.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|you know that what you were told.
PS04Y|No no no no no.
PS04U|and I think.
PS04Y|Yes well I think I told him a wrong you see there were two there there are two ways of tackling it and I don't think the way I told him is what they want for the examination purposes at all.
PS04U|Oh I don't know he under when you that told he understood it a lot more than when she said it and she sort of went all.
PS04Y|She's probably trying to explain them in a very complicated way of doing maths.
PS04U|No she answered me she said well I haven't got time to sit down explain it to them they just got ta if they're in a high level they should be able to grasp it and I.
PS04Y|Frankly I think that's very bad.
PS04U|that's no attitude.
PS04Y|you know that is no attitude That's bad.
PS04U|You know the fact is they've got to erm be explained.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|Erm I mean Carla I can't fault her teachers.
PS04Y|No no.
PS04U|at that church one she has learnt so much erm I mean this to speak French now she speaking it in three weeks.
PS04Y|She's excellent isn't she yes.
PS04U|You know it's unbeliev.
PS04Y|Three weeks.
PS04U|three weeks that's all she's been doing it.
PS04Y|That's marvellous.
PS04U|You know I mean but this teacher won't stand no nonsense and I said to Lee y you were at it three years before you could speak like Carla speaks it You know she has learnt so much Erm i in this school I mean.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|they're very strict I mean.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|you know but I think half of Lee's it there's no discipline.
PS04Y|No ha.
PS04U|but then.
PS04Y|and when you try t in the past when I tried to find some way of imposing discipline there is no way because quite rightly you're not allowed to strike children I never wanted to and I I hardly ever did at one school where there was a marvellous spirit of give and take I used to whip off my little black velvet slipper occasionally and whack some of the larger boys about the top of the thigh just for fun you know but I'm not a believer in using your fists you ought to be using your brain to teach with but there were no there are no sanctions if you say you must stay behind after school you have to send a letter home and half the parents will write back and say my son or daughter is not staying after school and that is that.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|And that's their right and so you think of something else we you're not allowed to take them out of a favourite lesson you're not allowed to say you are going to miss your football or a P E P E teachers and the football teachers quite rightly say if you can't keep discipline in your class why why should we be penalized.
PS04U|Mm that's right.
PS04Y|And er you're pretty helpless really.
PS04U|You are.
PS04Y|You see the only way that you can really discipline them is when you have a school where the rules have been very very strict from the moment that they went into that school and they have had their noses held to the grindstone with work up to their brows and they just don't think of being tiresome and anybody who is tiresome is pulled out and put in a special room on their own called a sin bin an which is rather boring and made to work even harder.
PS04U|Mm but no what I'm sort of getting back I mean you know I don't I think it's the kids I mean I du n no why Whether they have too much or what they have but I mean they're just they just think everybody owes them something and it's like Neil I mean to me I mean I can't see why he can't get off his backside and go and work in a supermarket but it's not the job they want the same answer I said to.
PS04Y|I think at the moment Brenda he would take any job if he could get one.
PS04U|He would take if offered it.
PS04Y|Yes I think so I.
PS04U|There's a lot of I mean it's like.
PS04Y|To be fair to be fair to him I think that he would erm he's set his heart on going and working at the lawn mower place on the production line.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and he isn't in my opinion really considering half the other jobs but he has said that he wants that and by the mercy of providence this business of Lee being flung out by Andy and being put back onto the into the job centre coincides with my being very tight on money.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|You'll notice that I've said to you we're going to run the.
PS04U|That's right yeah.
PS04Y|And I'm going to pay it back with lodgers money really.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|I mean my dear I said to Paul Paul yesterday was was babbling on about if Karen would take him back and I said Paul I shall be extremely displeased if you ever leave this house to go back to Karen you know o after only being with me for something like three or four weeks I said you'll never come back again I said I'm not going to be messed about like that.
PS04U|No that's right What did he say to that.
PS04Y|Oh I'm counting on you lodgers money.
PS04U|That's right.
PS04Y|And I am Brenda.
PS04U|Yeah but thing is I mean you know there's a lot of kids out there I mean I've know with sort of Lee's friend you know okay with us I mean with Lee o okay we don't I've often said to him why don't you get a Saturday job And he said no and I said okay fair enough but then you know you can say to Lee well if you want something now you're gon na have to work.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|and then he will he'll go and do something.
PS04Y|Yes mm let's go here I won't talk.
PS04U|Erm.
PS04Y|Erm.
PS04U|but thing is there's a lot lot of like Lee's friends and that and they say well I couldn't work in a shoe shop and I wouldn't work in a and I say why.
PS04Y|Quite.
PS04U|Well they say well would you do jobs you don't like Yes if I need the money.
PS04Y|The the only job which I told Neil I do not expect him to take is working for waste disposal because he did that this time last year and before he started he was full of big talk about you make a lot of money and you get a lot of tips at Christmas he found that you do not make a lot of money and you do not get generous tips at Christmas.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and he used to come home looking as white as a sheet sick to the teeth and he used to just go to bed and collapse in a heap he isn't strong enough to do it and it's pointless for him to try but other than that he can do anything he fancies.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|I vir I just got.
PS04U|Neil I mean he.
PS04U|No but I mean he has had a bad start.
PS04Y|and hasn't had the example of either a mother or a father who understands the necessity of.
PS04U|But there are a lot of.
PS04Y|work.
PS04U|that have had the support but they won't get off their backsides and it tends to be this ge generation.
PS04Y|Well you know when my son was eighteen he and his friends were entertaining each other to pocket parties at which they were working out what University courses they were going to apply for.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and what they wanted was the easiest ones and they came up with the answer economics Gerald simply we Ge Gerry and I put our heads together and went bib bib bib bib bib you know as good parents do and we both presented him with a fait accompli you either take an engineering degree we don't care what sort or you go out to work in a bank because economics you will not get a first because you are not reader and t to get a first in economics which is what you'll need if you're gon na make any money out of it.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|and have a decent life to get a first or either a two one in economics you have got to read a very great deal you've got to be a reader a student a taker of notes a writer of essays and we said that is not you so within two.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|minutes he was looking through all the advertisements for civil engineering.
PS04U|That's right but you had the encouragement who's that waving.
PS04Y|Who where.
PS04U|That car in front I du n no he was waving I just hope it wasn't waving at us.
PS04Y|That one E E.
PS04U|I du n no.
PS04Y|The Fiesta.
PS04U|Maybe she wasn't waving at us.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|it was only for a minute.
PS04Y|Oh.
PS04U|No no no she's not.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|I think she's realized she's made a mistake she was waving away.
PS04Y|Oh yes yes yes.
PS04U|And thought it was somebody else.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|But er no I mean there's th there's.
PS04U|that they've just you know I mean some of the kids I don't know where we were going me and Dave somewhere or other we were and there was some kids an and their attitude you know it's well why should we do this you know.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|this isn't fair I mean life's not fair.
PS04Y|I think it's the television as much as anything else.
PS04U|Yeah probably yeah tha that does.
PS04Y|I mean I'm appalled at the way that teenagers are still being shown on the television as they were twenty years ago able to rule the roost because they did.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|They did erm twenty years ago a teenager a girl of sixteen could leave home she could pick up a job just like that.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|And you know get reasonable money and there were there were still rented rooms of a sort but she could find somewhere of a sort to live with other kids and they could do what they jolly well liked.
PS04U|I du n no it's I mean you know it's.
PS04Y|But those days are well and truly over And I don't think they'll ever come back For one thing I I don't think that the next generation of parents are going to stand it because with the cos I told you what what I said Neil about erm when er when he was a father I said if you had a pretty fifteen year old daughter would you want to have some rough oaf taking her down a back alley and screwing her No I bloody wouldn't he said cor that's awful and it it's just what he's been doing.
PS04U|Doing that's it it's alright for him to do it.
PS04Y|okay for him but nobody's going to touch his little girl.
PS04U|Ah but erm.
PS04Y|Or my own boy.
PS04U|no I mean I I do really feel sorry Neil because people wa it it it makes me cross because people won't give Neil the benefit of the doubt.
PS04Y|No they won't they won't.
PS04U|You know and if they just won't give him a chance.
PS04Y|No they won't.
PS04U|And I mean the fact you know y you can see his point I mean.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|Harry hasn't given up totally I mean he hasn't.
PS04Y|No he would've done if you hadn't but he says this.
PS04U|I mean he feels like it obviously like with.
PS04Y|Oh yes.
PS04U|his driving.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|What's the point I've got.
PS04Y|Yep.
PS04U|no confidence who cares you know whether I pass or that I mean.
PS04Y|Well I did we we talked about this you see Mary Anne half way through the conversation er Neil went out of the room so that I could to Mary Ann and I said towards the end of my conversation you know Mary Ann you're a very wise person give me some advice I said I told her about Neil not wanting no not doing well on the driving although he can drive she said he doesn't want to do it she said don't hassle him so when he came downstairs I said I've been talking to Mary Ann and she sends you her love and because of course you know we've got a grandson you know she had a son my.
PS04U|That's right yeah.
PS04Y|grandson is about that age and very sympathetic she is erm I said er Mary Ann says she doesn't know what the point is you don't really want to do it he said she's right I don't he said in a way I do in another way I don't I said.
PS04U|You see.
PS04Y|well we can't go into the reasons for that but I said let's respect the reasons I said if that's how you feel I said you're a man you you must make your own decisions I said probably in a few months time you'll come.
