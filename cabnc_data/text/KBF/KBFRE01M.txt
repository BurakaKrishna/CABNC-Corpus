PS04W|Different isn't it.
PS04U|And totally different outlook interests No I think either Guildford.
PS04W|I think Guildford.
PS04U|Ideal for me Cause it's got the University and evening classes and all the rest of it Well it's a city well isn't actually is it It's a town and Neil would get more chance.
PS04W|Neil would get more chance in working Yeah.
PS04U|Because you know there's a lot more going on in Guildford Mind you I mean what I think Woking's going to be a lot more for youngsters We've got the bowling alley opening in in February.
PS04W|Yes.
PS04U|I don't know what kids would be able to afford it So what age what age is it going to apply.
PS04W|You see this business of Neil staying in bed all day Part of it is that interests Except his karate but then he hasn't got the money to follow things up anyway.
PS04U|No I always think I mean it it just annoys me though I think I get well I just get I just think it's a waste of the day.
PS04W|Well it is but I musn't let it annoy me Brenda because in a way he must know what he's doing.
PS04U|Well that's it I mean.
PS04W|He's probably used staying in bed as his escape.
PS04U|Oh that's it cause you won't be so bored will you.
PS04W|Got away from your mother and.
PS04U|The fact you're sleeping you're not thinking about it.
PS04W|That's right That's right.
PS04U|And you know you try and sort of block things out It's just a sort of mental.
PS04W|Yes yes.
PS04U|escape really It's a sort of block out.
PS04W|I know that Pam Palmer said of one of her friends whose husband who's having he didn't like his work He's not happy And she said er Angela said to her oh poor Neil has to stays in bed until oneo'clock every Saturday and then on Sunday he has a he gets up late and then he has a long rest in the afternoon and Pam said to me he's copping out.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04W|As you see Jerry who was at ease with when he like everybody and there were times when his job got him down But his attitude he'd been taught to get on and do things so that he would be painting the back of the house or going on with his hobby or doing jobs on the car He would just do them Well you've got to get on with it haven't you.
PS04W|Yes.
PS04U|You can't you know I'd be interested to know whether Neil did that list of things I asked him to do.
PS04W|Like what.
PS04U|Well I asked him to bring the dust bins in Empty the dishwasher erm with Paul's help to re-hang the curtains You know that my big the curtains to the patio You know they're on brown rings with little little tiny screw screwed in metal rings in the brown things.
PS04W|Hm.
PS04U|And you thread them on the curtains through this little metal ring Well those have started to come away Now you can't just replace them You've got to take the whole down You've got to lift the whole lot off the wall and unthread the curtains and put back the right number of rings and hooks and it's a palaver and I haven't done it I took the thing down but I haven't put it back So I said the rings are in the top drawer of the bureau in the garage If you go and get them get Paul to help you to remount the whole thing It needs somebody with or whatever you see.
PS04W|Mm.
PS04U|There's that to do And what else was there Oh I asked him to go to the insurance company and find out whether I'm covered with them for having my aerial replaced and I wrote a letter asking if he could be empowered to sign the claim form for me.
PS04U|Now I wonder whether he managed to do it.
PS04W|Did you leave him a note Or did you just ask him to do it.
PS04U|I wrote it down I wrote it all down I asked him as I wrote it down.
PS04W|What did he say.
PS04U|Well because he was half at the time it was just before I left at about nine to come down here you see.
PS04W|Mm.
PS04U|Having said that you don't know whether.
PS04W|You don't know.
PS04U|How he's feeling at the moment.
PS04W|No no.
PS04U|Oh I do know how he's feeling He's feeling he's feeling defeated.
PS04W|Well now.
PS04U|That's it I mean the thing is You try not to you know I mean You think to yourself oh well You know things will get better you just feel Oh God I've been through this.
PS04U|That's right Every slightest thing is very dramatic to me.
PS04W|Yes yes at the moment.
PS04U|Where you know I would just take things in my stride But the slightest thing is so stupid When I went to that stress management course we were told to use physical resources like deep breathing and actually making yourself sit down and making yourself go floppy and let every muscle let it relax That was a power That's a week or so.
PS04W|Oh marvellous.
PS04U|When I first when I was first driving in the early ninteen seventies you could park in the quarry car park any time you fancied except the few days before Christmas.
PS04W|Don't they charge you.
