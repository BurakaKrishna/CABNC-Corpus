PS04X|These are brilliant.
PS04Y|from Liverpool Street I wanted to get to Oxford Circus which meant that I had to change at I forget where now because I'm in such a a muddle now after all this.
PS04Y|where ever it was whatever it was I had to do I got stuck there were there were just no underground trains in either direction on that line at all and a a great tanner went.
PS04X|dad.
PS04Y|and I looked at people we were all saying why we waiting here why we waiting and we saw people rushing off so we thought we've got to rush off after them and we were all put on the train and sent to Charing Cross which wasn't where most of us wanted to go or anything like we wanted to go.
PS04Y|and from Charing Cross.
PS04X|Those pretty good.
PS04Y|I worked my way over.
PS04Y|on an underground train which couldn't decide if it's going to move or not it did eventually move I got a taxi at one point and I was so sick and tired and they put me outside Liberties I gave the man a twenty pound note and he gave me change for a ten yes coming back from Oxford Circus from Liberty's I thought I'd better economise I've been done out of ten pounds I don't think it was dishonesty I think it was just sheer muddle I I'm ten pounds down I'm must cut down a bit so I will come back underground from Oxford Circus to Waterloo to get down to and you've guessed it I got into an an underground train which would not move it simply stuck and it would go chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga then it would stop in the tunnel for a while while its.
