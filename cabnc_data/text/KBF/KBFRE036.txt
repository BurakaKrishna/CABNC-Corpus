PS04V|Getting over a cold right.
PS04W|Mhm.
PS04V|And you've been far from very well And you are going to be going skiing January the fourth which is not many days away Right Now my opinion if any I would say don't sleep round James's house for one Right For the simple reason that you won't go to bed till late in the morning or whatever which would knock you back Right.
PS04W|Mm.
PS04V|The other one is phone Pete up and tell him that you've been off sick for a week can't play football this week Right Then next week have the weekend off Still go out Don't stay in I'm not saying stay indoors you can still go out and next week get yourself you decide in yourself to do your own training Go to football training by all means.
PS04W|But how can I cos I've got.
PS04U|Exams every day.
PS04W|Yeah School work.
PS04V|But I've got work every day But I still come home and do it I don't wan na do it It's if you want to do something I'm I'm I'm it's like I said to you I'm not telling you to do it But I tell you something now when you go skiing on January the fourth I've never skied but I can assure you this James I know for a fact is going to special lessons Now if you're not fit and you're just getting over a cold now so there's no way your fit you're gon na be well an absolute disaster out there And yet I tell you what and if you go and play football on Sunday and you're not a hundred percent fit from this cold you've lost all next week as well But er I mean that's that's your decision I was you're old enough to I'm just Whether it's a hard match or what it's up to you.
PS04U|It is isn't it.
PS04V|Tell me something then If it if it was a match on a Tuesday this week would you have played.
PS04W|No.

PS04V|You're doing Pete no favours Cos Pete putting out a good alright Pete might say if say you you just rung up to say look Pete I'm sorry He won't tell the players and he'll say alright I haven't got a team so he can cancel the match.
PS04U|I'd give him a ring tonight Lee and get then he might have time to ge chance to get some players Will they.
PS04V|You've got ta get your think but if you don't get yourself right you're gon na be in a right two and eight.
