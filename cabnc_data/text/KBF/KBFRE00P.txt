PS04Y|Marriage agency.
PS04U|What Dateline.
PS04Y|No Destiny a local one.
PS04U|Oh you're not with Dateline any more.
PS04Y|No no good Not for me this local one is absolutely splendid.
PS04U|Is it.
PS04Y|Mm You ca.
PS04U|What about.
PS04Y|You can talk to the man who's running it.
PS04U|Is Ron still going with his.
PS04Y|Oh yes he's still with Trudy.
PS04U|Do you reckon he'll end up getting married.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|No what on her side or his.
PS04Y|Her side she won't have it.
PS04U|Won't she.
PS04Y|No I've warned Ron he's such an obstinate so and so he won't be told I said that I think you'll find Ron that Trudy if she married would have to give up her late husband's occupational widow's pension so that the way you're going on now where you go and stay with her for two or three days at a time is far better oh no no no she'll be able to keep her pension I said I very much doubt it then I said people are so jealous that if she does marry you and he doesn't tell the firm I bet that one of her dear neighbours will oh no they're all very nice people round where she lives I thought there's no good arguing with Ron.
PS04U|Would she lose he pension then if she got married.
PS04Y|Well mostly yes.
PS04U|Careful when you put your cup.
PS04Y|If you haven't if you worked if you haven't worked at th sorry.
PS04U|Careful when you pick that up it's ever so slippery.
PS04Y|Oh my God If you get a a pension based on the fact that you're your late husband's widow when you are no longer your late husband's widow but somebody's wife they don't have to pay you that pension.
PS04U|Oh so I suppose Trudy doesn't know either.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|Actually I can't blame her.
PS04Y|No and she doesn't want Ron to move into her house because there is no way that he could.
PS04U|The thing is he's so isn't he.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|It doesn't sort of change anything Has he organized his.
PS04Y|Sorry.
PS04U|Will he organize his.
PS04Y|No not really no it's still a great big muddly tip You have seen it haven't you.
PS04U|No.
PS04Y|Oh oh you must.
PS04U|Cos how old is he.
PS04Y|Seventy.
PS04U|He's quite good for seventy in he.
PS04Y|Oh very oh yes.
PS04U|The thing is now you see there's no way would you change him.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|But he wouldn't want it would he.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|This is lovely.
PS04Y|Mm I mean poor old Ron.
PS04U|He's been going with her quite a while though has he.
PS04Y|Yes oh yes.
PS04U|So she's just happy with that relationship is she.
PS04Y|Yes in fact to be perfectly honest with you the relationship is a bit more than she wants Ron is a bit of a pain I told him over and over again not to push his luck I said for goodness sake Ron be grateful for what you've got apparently she doesn't like to make love with the lights on I said well if that's what she doesn't like that's what she doesn't like you're not going to change a woman of sixty eight Oh the way she and her husband went on that's all in the past I said yes but it's there was an awful lot of it.
PS04U|That's right he should really especially tha at her age.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|He should sort of honour her wishes shouldn't he.
PS04Y|He should.
PS04U|So has he all gone to his gr mother's at Christmas.
