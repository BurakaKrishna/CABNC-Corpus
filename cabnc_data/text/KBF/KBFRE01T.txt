PS04U|Got your seat belt on.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|It's only twoo'clock.
PS04Y|Amazing.
PS04U|Yeah.
PS04Y|No but I really feel like going back and putting my feet up and chatting to you a bit more cos we haven't chatted enough have we.
PS04U|No well we've got the bulk we were only going to be in Woking an hour.
PS04Y|Yes we haven't chatted enough.
PS04U|Well you try telling the the er tape deck.
PS04Y|oh.
PS04U|You really feel I mean with really sort of put into it and really done well haven't we.
PS04Y|Oh I couldn't have done a quarter of it.
PS04U|And I get on less than two people.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|and that's it.
PS04Y|I think I've done a quarter of it.
PS04U|I.
PS04Y|I'd dithered and I'd got tired and I'd gone off and been.
PS04U|Think oh well I come back I can't.
PS04Y|That's right do it again oh I have another go at it Oh I could have spent the whole week I just I just I could of spent five afternoons in Ipswich would of done or Norwich.
PS04U|Mm I think I would of done cos I I work at the cos a couple of weeks ago I thought I'd go I'll make an effort I thought.
PS04Y|I think it makes a very big difference knowing that the.
PS04U|Yeah.
PS04Y|without having to think too hard.
PS04U|and you still you make sure you I mean you know all that what I've spent.
PS04Y|Oh it was well.
PS04U|It's got everybody.
PS04Y|Yeah its within your budget and you've done well I went over budget but then I expected I would because for one thing I was buying for more.
PS04U|Yeah cos you had you I mean none of us realised you had thirty to odd to buy.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|I don't think you really realised really did you.
PS04Y|I didn't but I remember when you said that that last year when I counted up.
PS04U|Its fifty odd I think fifty three.
PS04Y|With the er erm was it years before that I've had something like forty or thirty five.
PS04U|Yep.
PS04Y|in what you might call quite years.
PS04U|But those some of those calendars in Smith with two pounds off were lovely.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|and the ones we saw at Marks and all that were nothing were they.
PS04Y|Well it pays to tramp around you see the problem with Jackie and Len has always been that they can not believe that you can get things in a place like W H Smith that will that will do very nicely as a Christmas present they tend to go.
PS04Y|always to the top of the.
PS04U|Well it doesn't pay just queue up doing anything.
PS04Y|You know they they yes yes they go to the Madechie shops and Athena or whatever and there looking at the best and you can't afford it See Maryann and Richard are given up on erm buying Christmas presents because she says your buying things for people they don't really want everybody therefore I think tokeny things are the best and that's what I've bought this year.
PS04U|And is that what you.
PS04Y|Tokeny things.
PS04U|is that what she's doing.
PS04Y|there buying disposable presents like giving theatre vouchers and erm I don't know what else but she said disposable's things that people can have some fun with.
PS04U|Good idea isn't it.
PS04Y|Mm and what I'm giving is just something nice in the spirit of Christmas but it hasn't broken my bank or my back.
PS04U|Thing is the how these people go week after week after week looking for a bargain I mean Christm I mean we picked up some bargains today but how you can go week I mean its ok yes why your but when your Christmas shopping you can't.
PS04Y|No no you can't.
PS04U|Because its just so I mean that C and A it was the same as the it was.
PS04Y|Mm mm mm.
PS04U|it so claustrophobic.
PS04Y|yeah.
PS04U|look at this traffic coming in now I think the way we did it we marked down the three shops we wanted to do.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|and you make we just do those three shops.
PS04Y|Yes yes I don't think that on our next buy what with the next year I would be a bit better off in the sense that I should have sold my house bought something cheaper and have some capital invested so I have a little extra monthly income I should be living in somewhere that's cheaper to run.
PS04U|You don't know you might end up with this chap your with.
PS04Y|Oh I wouldn't marry him Bre I wouldn't marry anybody Brenda.
PS04U|No but you might live with him.
PS04Y|Don't know.
PS04Y|don't know don't know.
PS04U|and then yes you can buy a smaller house even more so then.
PS04Y|Well I would I I mean I kept to keep my own.
PS04U|But.
PS04Y|whatever your your in it and look after it yes erm well I don't think I'll ever again buy expensive Christmas presents in the way that I did in the past.
PS04U|No.
PS04Y|Spending forty and fifty pounds ahead on.
PS04U|don't it.
PS04Y|Mm yeah.
PS04U|Like your just tracksuits and.
PS04Y|Yes no I can't erm I can't think of myself as doing that again.
PS04U|I agree its its like those their lovely little things don't think of buying it's not very fair cos I mean Mar I mean I'd be over the moon if someone bought me one of those bags.
PS04Y|Yeah.
PS04U|You know but people don't they think oh know there only one twenty five and they can't buy someone that.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|cos its not wro not the issue of it is it.
PS04Y|No no it isn't.
PS04U|go home.
PS04Y|Yesterday we bought yeah.
PS04U|And that.
PS04Y|Where my goodness.
PS04U|I think that's a good idea there isn't a bet there be a real seller those boxes they I know they call them the.
PS04Y|Oh yes.
PS04U|You had to buy a box then the tissue paper.
PS04Y|Oh no.
PS04U|then the bow.
PS04Y|the time consuming getting it all in.
PS04U|I think all I would do is just to wrap it up bow yeah buy some of that cheap stuff.
PS04Y|Yes.
PS04U|and curl it.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|display it on the top she saved on wrapping papers and the bows want to get some petrol have to get some get some what did you ask in Guilford to what why you asked for B H S about.
PS04Y|erm do you think erm.
PS04Y|It'll come to me.
PS04U|I don't know how many of those tops you've got on Green one.
PS04Y|I've only got this one I had a cream one and it got wrecked by going I think Neil put it in the wash with one of his black tee shirts and.
PS04U|Did.
PS04Y|it came out all purple bluey.
PS04U|Its really top.
PS04Y|it is its very soft and easy to wear and.
PS04U|Now erm should buy a couple more of them if you see them.
PS04Y|Well I don't know erm.
PS04U|They warm.
PS04Y|they are warm er but its colour I don't know whether I perhaps I if I saw cream again this year I might buy it but erm I'm not sure that I want erm there's this deep red because I've I've bought a red one in a different style same sort of fabric its very do you remember when I bought that black and white checked skirt I bought a red.
PS04U|Oh yeah.
PS04Y|blouse.
PS04U|yes but the sleeve the sleeve.
PS04Y|trying to get it together and I would of got it together if I for being nice.
PS04U|Of course he does.
PS04Y|Doesn't listen to a word I say like the women's no good cos I told some things about which would really made yet more of his hair fall of the top of his bald head I said I said look a working women needs a working man to help support herself and her children I said er no nobody is going to be able these days a woman not going to be able to support herself on twenty hours a week which is what Karen does putting out bread in the Asda.
PS04U|Is she the original one then.
PS04Y|She's the original one.
PS04U|She's not the one that was coming round with the baby.
PS04Y|no it was Michelle that was coming round with the baby.
PS04U|right.
PS04Y|and I found two pairs of Michelle's knickers after that I didn't know what now I don't know how they manage this year because she was coming round in the day with little Donna with her and I was around there you are you see these they they will love and find a way anyway erm I said dear look a woman needs a man to support her I said mark my words when the chap that she's got at the moment is taken her out to disco's and things she'll find that he doesn't really want to kick in and help to support her I said she she might well come back to you I said she's tried to keep you on a string just in case she didn't land the next dish he looked horrified you know as far as he's concerned its all love and glamour.
PS04U|How come she took him back then they didn't want.
PS04Y|Well I think that she was trying to keep him dangling so that she had somebody to fall back on if she didn't land another man.
PS04U|He wasn't.
PS04Y|Why she's landed.
PS04U|was she playing around with another man.
PS04Y|She is now she is now yes she's now carrying on.
PS04U|What did he do.
PS04Y|Erm his sleeping she's told him that she's got this other man.
PS04U|Cos I can remember him saying before he used to drive round to spy.
PS04Y|Yes well there is another man and she's told Paul frankly she's lapping up the attention he's taking her out for meals and their having a good time together you know why its great but as soon as he's paid for for the goods and got got the goods the chaps going to go off looking for another.
PS04Y|yes he doesn't want to stay with her but I've told Paul that if he goes back to Karen and take some of his things out then he takes all of his things out and himself and he never comes back.
PS04U|Just er he can't keep on.
PS04Y|I've had this twice and each time its been its been other people because his got a lot of goods people's belongings out of one cupboard into another and the second time round there's been purgatory because he brought Karen's house her hoover and the saucepans and everything that was his everything that belonged to him but he said that before I said why was Michelle able to jumped in between him and Karen he said well Karen had been getting moody and he said Karen was getting bored Paul is boring she's told Paul that his boring boring.
PS04U|No cos I could imagine Paul sort of being quite a homely chap.
PS04Y|He is.
PS04U|if he gets the right sort of.
PS04Y|he is.
PS04U|if someone that could put up with his sort of quite reservation.
PS04Y|yes.
PS04U|cos he likes to chat.
PS04Y|yeah.
PS04U|and.
PS04Y|yes.
PS04U|but I mean.
PS04Y|He's a pleasant enough chap.
PS04U|he is that's it.
PS04Y|yes but he is not erm a playboy he's not going to spend money on like Pete was forever buying Pam cheap jewellery from Ratners and rubbish from that nature.
PS04U|Did he ever get back with her.
PS04Y|Well she tells me that she is going to throw Shaun out because Shaun is boring er Don put her Shaun she has no respect for she says because he hasn't got a job he won't get a job he won't work and she said to Lee what did I think of the idea of taking Pete back once they were properly divorced take Pete back just as a lover and I said that sounds to me to be a very good idea I said then your not at his mercy because anybody who's at Pete's mercy will suffer his got a very nasty streak his got a nasty snide way of putting things.
PS04U|Has he.
PS04Y|Oh yes nasty.
PS04U|But his he is he he's quite fond of her isn't he.
PS04Y|Oh he adores her oh yes he wants her back and I said she said I you see I know him I said there's a lot to be said for a chap that you know inside know his ways and know how to cope with them but I said never ever put yourself at his mercy I'm marrying him and the house will be hers you see when there properly divorced it'll be in her name so if he starts coming the old soldier she can bung him out.
PS04U|Did she bail herself out in the end with over her money situation.
PS04Y|Well I I went guarantor for that.
PS04U|Oh you hate did you have to pay the money cos you had.
PS04Y|No no she managed I told her on pain of death not to tell Pete that I was backing.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|erm cos otherwise he would of sat back and said oh Jean can pay that.
PS04U|that's right.
PS04Y|But she knew that in the last resort if he did I would do it but he's he's paid off now as soon as he'd paid off he went on the dole again.
PS04U|I don't think quite.
PS04Y|He's quite a gipsy you know he looks like a gipsy did you meet him.
PS04U|No we never met him.
PS04Y|Oh plausible rogue.
PS04U|My god look at the queue to get in the car park.
