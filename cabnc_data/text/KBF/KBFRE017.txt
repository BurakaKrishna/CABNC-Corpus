PS04Y|Absolutely bumbling over with.
PS04Y|life.
PS04U|Should see her work her books.
PS04Y|I mean my poor Neil tried to commit suicide in nineteen eighty nine.

PS04X|Monday.
PS04U|Is everybody gon na do it or is it your choice if you do it.
PS04X|You can either draw it model it made me draw the last one I'll model it this time it's good fun.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|If you use the.
PS04X|So this one looks better.
PS04U|You said you had to model it but make it squeeze it in the middle so it's fatter at the ends that's it so it looks like a canoe.
PS04V|Bren.
PS04U|paddle yeah.
PS04V|What's that back of your car.
PS04U|Oh I've opened the boot I got ta bring you wan na bring all the shopping in Dave ha ha.

PS04V|Bring it in.
PS04Y|Mm mm mm mm.
PS04X|What ha what about if all the pen what if I put some extra tin foil just a bit at the end.
PS04Y|Oh I don't know really I haven't thought.
PS04X|I got a bit left over from when I cut it I'll just bring it in this bit there.
PS04Y|I've sort of squeezed the tin foil so that it it fits very very tightly around the middle.
PS04X|Oh ah.
PS04Y|And then it bulges at the end you see that'll do cos if you.
PS04X|What about if I do an extra bit at the end.
PS04Y|Well I don't think it'll be a good idea at all because my no my knowledge of tin foil leads me to believe that tin foil wrapped on tin foil falls off.
PS04X|Oh.
PS04Y|I think you'll be better off with it like that.
PS04X|Where's my.
PS04U|Not yours.

PS04Y|Because I can't I can't eat all that much.
PS04U|No when I lost it I th I don't want to be this thin I want to put it on again.
PS04Y|I went out I went out with Peggy er on Wednesday er for meal and she's been saving Daily Telegraph vouchers and when you got so many vouchers you send them up to the Daily Telegraph who's sent them it's offers closed now and they send you a thing like a credit card and they send you a list of all the places that you can go to for a price meal.
