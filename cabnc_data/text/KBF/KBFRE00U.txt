PS04V|So it's a right pain.
PS04U|Unless there's a special fluid or something they could put it in there to wash through.
PS04V|You can't because it wouldn't come out through the taps would it For someone like Nigel who's got all the tools it it'd be a a it's not a job you can come in and just do it cos you have to take a bit off clean it.

PS04V|The si it's all round the sides you don't really need a top on a tank it's just the sides you want.
PS04Y|Can you come on the neo have you come on the insurance Can you come on Les and can he come on his insurance.
PS04U|I doubt it.
PS04V|I mean estimated.
PS04Y|Ah.
PS04V|because Nigel like privately.
PS04U|We didn't we haven't cos Les has to go through the books and charge.
PS04Y|Ah yes of course.

PS04V|And me being a silly idiot see if I'd realized I didn't think you don't think that there's three parts of the tank you think it's a tank and you just turn your tap on and the water comes out or.
PS04Y|Do you know Dave I read erm we there's a magazine called Good Housekeeping and it's been going for it had been going for seventy years last year it started in nineteen twenty one women's magazine very good one and they had a sort of seventieth birthday issue.
PS04U|Do you want a cup of tea now.
PS04Y|and one woman said that the year nineteen twenty one she was a bride of eighteen years old and she took Good Housekeeping and she's got the whole lot although she's now a very old lady and she said my first lot of housekeeping was done in a house in Wales where we had water from the well we had to build the fires up by hand we could get Welsh coal cheaply but they had to you know use paper and kindle and we swept with brooms and my life has never been easier she said I had three children in four years and my life has never been easier she said and all these modern things came in life has got more and more complicated and difficult.
PS04V|You're not kidding he certainly ain't kidding you now now it's happened to me I know if it ever happened I know never to do it again.
PS04Y|The the the buggeration of it is that the next time round that something goes wrong it'll be again something that you've encountered before.

PS04V|Yeah.
PS04Y|and one boy chose to write about plumbing and do you know he found that there was nothing written down about plumbing in the early nineteen seventies there were one or two plumbing text books they were very expensive and you could only get them through The Institute of Plumbers plumbing is something that until about nineteen seventy five was passed from father to son or uncle to nephew it was a sort of secret craft you know you can.
