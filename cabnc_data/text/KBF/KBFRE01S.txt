PS04Y|Yes yes When I have have been entertaining Shirley and Terry doing an evening meal on a Saturday or a Sunday sometimes both to help Shirley when she's getting into the run of going back to work I found that one of the cheapest of dinner party deserts is lemon meringue pie.

PS04Y|Yes everybody yes It's fairly typical though isn't it one year you.
PS04U|Mm mm.
PS04Y|could do with.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|staying around you mean I think that Neil is a bit of a sensitive area.
PS04U|Mm.
PS04Y|You know cos I'm I'm spending money and time on him that really has those in theory I would be spending on my own grand children however I take the attitude that in modern times people don't people are not obliged.
PS04U|The thing is today our.
PS04Y|To feel by duty as it were that they ought to take notice of their immediate family John and Maryann are capable of financially supporting themselves so I don't worry about the money aspect and in every other way physiologically emotionally immorally they they are able to look after themselves Neil isn't.
PS04U|But I think yeah and I think that that saying you can't pick your families you can pick your friends.
PS04Y|Mm this is true.
PS04U|So true.
PS04Y|Mm.
PS04U|because nine times out of ten.
PS04Y|You found it so.

PS04Y|Mm mm.
PS04U|at least there's not a lot of types that have hassle's.
PS04Y|No no.
PS04U|But that's how relationships should be.
PS04Y|Mm mm its one of the great arguments from the old fashioned sort of religion that you could turn you could definitely turn to people and say why are you leaning on me so hard for all this to fought you ought to be reading your bible saying your prayers going to church and getting in touch with the boss why I laughed when they were saying that Terry Waite would need counselling I bet that Terry Waite was praying his head off and he'd memorised masses of the bible which he would be reciting to himself probably set himself twoo'clock every afternoon I remember what I can book of you know I don't suppose he'd needed any counselling he'd probably do better counselling other people.
PS04U|That's right yeah cos I mean he's he's certainly sort of even though he's been sort of prisoner I mean he's seen what's going on and and he's had what five years of it.
PS04Y|Yes yeah.

PS04U|No.
PS04Y|There aren't any people where they are.
PS04U|Aren't there.
PS04Y|Well there are next door neighbours who I think are very nice but I don't think that Jackie and Ned got a lot in common with them that's tha that's one house that adjoins them and then a little further on its a lane its about as wide as this Brenda.
PS04U|Oh well why'd they moved What what area is it.
PS04Y|Its called Fen Fen Lane.
PS04Y|and its in between Creeping St Mary and.
PS04U|And how far is it from you.
PS04Y|About erm between ten and fifteen minutes drive I suppose ten minutes perhaps.
PS04U|Oh it's not far.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|does she still do her kitchen job.
PS04Y|Yes and she phoned me and she said I feel as though I dropped out of the bottom of the world she said you know I just don't see anybody I said well of course you were working on Mondays you see she used to have Mondays to herself and I would often go round on a Monday afternoon and we we could talk but that's gone and I said I can't run in at half past five when you get home from school and chat to you because Ned will be coming home at six and I don't want to be there all that often when he's there erm its you know its just happened and I also thought to myself and I'm probably going to move a lot further away then Fen Lane.
PS04U|But she doesn't I mean she doesn't bother that much now does she.
PS04Y|No.
PS04U|I mean I think it counts that she's not.
PS04Y|To tell you the truth Brenda I'm very sorry for her because I think that she and Ned have made a really a quite ferocious mess of their life they've never intended to be slaving away to be doing kitchen fitting he wanted to do wood sculpture that was he's idea in.
PS04U|And slow down a bit you was.
PS04Y|yes yes he's on the gallop and looks very old and worn.
PS04U|Does he.

PS04Y|such as it is if she is no I have to go to the a loo or something get some paper I shan't worry about them such a.
