PS19L|It's going to be his baby when it's a good baby.
PS19U|I know.

PS19L|Yeah.
PS19U|and I just I threw buckets of water on it to rinse it and it dried because it was really warm and it came up like new.
PS19L|Came up like new.
PS19U|cos you can have a real good go at the wheels that way outside.
PS19L|Yeah outside it's like my pram I mean I was Stacey was going in hospital last year to have her adeno adenoids out and Sue was having him and I thought well he was too big for his carrycot but take the pram down and he's got nothing to sleep in and er I put him in it it been six months since it was do well since he started using it so I give that a good going over and the pram wheels come up lovely.
PS19U|I know.
PS19L|you know I get a Brillo.
PS19U|Yeah.
PS19L|and some Jif on it but erm it's not been done since so when the next good bit of weather I've got to get the pushchair out and give that a good going over.
PS19U|And do that.
PS19L|and me pram as well.
PS19U|I know I fancied a big pram but there you go.
PS19L|Well it's whether you've really got somewhere to put it really that's the top and bottom of it.
PS19U|Well there's nowhere to walk to now is there you know.
PS19L|Well where would you mind you I suppose like in the olden days you could only get big prams they just had them in the living room didn't they.
PS19U|Yeah well it'd just have to go in the hall but no this will be better carrycot and that ridiculous prices though.
PS19L|Well it is it's different if you was if you was starting from scratch I suppose you know first baby you're inclined to you want everything new don't you with these new.
PS19U|Well I sort of said to him as well about I said and it's ridiculous just because I said the bedding had been lo in the loft.

PS19U|with the cot and everything he he sort of er thought it was.
PS19L|Well some lofts are lovely aren't they I mean our loft is a right mess.

PS19L|Mm.
PS19U|they only need washing I mean I might be wrong they might have they might have gone funny but I doubt it they've not been up there that long really only about two.
PS19L|Oh all of my stuff has been up in the loft it's like you say I mean if they've been double wrapped and everything and you wash them.
PS19U|he should put his hand in his pocket really and buy something.
PS19L|Of course he should you ought to just ask him for say a hundred you know to buy a couple of packs of nappies and some cream and changing mat a changing bag you'll want all that won't you.
PS19U|I know a changing bag could cost sixteen.
PS19L|Fifteen sixteen pounds and then you've got another six or seven pound for a changing mat you wan na say to him that you know can I have er some money I want to start getting us a few things together but you I mean what about clothes.
PS19U|I know he he said er he said about plus when I mentioned the pushchair and the carrycot he said oh well so I said yeah.

PS19U|Mm.
PS19L|Yuck yuck I like almonds and everything but.
PS19U|You just don't like.
PS19L|I just don't like marzipan I think it was something that to do when I was a kid to be honest.
PS19U|They do another sort and that's really nice it's called a nutty Vera.
PS19U|and it looks like this but it's a similar texture but it's a different taste it's got walnuts on the bit on the top.
PS19L|Oh.
PS19U|and what it is the man that bakes them it's a that makes his.
PS19L|Mm.
PS19U|and he's related to Vera Duckworth out of Coronation Street cos it's.
PS19L|Oh it's because.
PS19U|something like that.
PS19L|Oh.
PS19U|so he's done one after her a nutty Vera.
PS19L|I bet that's nice.
PS19U|That's what she said anyway.
PS19L|with nuts on instead of erm.
PS19U|Yeahd' ya know I could drink and drink and drink you know there only you get all the fingers caught it's like with an ironing board int it.
PS19L|Oh God yeah.
PS19U|It's like looking at another planet to a man.
PS19L|that's right what's that Is that marzipan.
PS19U|That is isn't it.
PS19L|Yes it is I'll have to dig that.
PS19U|Ah.
PS19L|and it's everything just to stop you getting at what well get it then yeah I've I don't mind some of it I've not had a bit of marzipan for I don't mind these erm almond slices I quite like them but I think it must be the texture of the marzipan.
PS19U|Mm I love it they do erm German erm marzipan bar chocolate bar.
PS19L|Oh aye.
PS19U|have you ever made marzipan.
PS19L|No.
PS19U|I did it in the sixth form it's really hard it takes ages.
PS19L|Does it.
PS19U|That's why I would think it's ground almonds they're expensive.
PS19L|That's right yeah.
PS19U|it and it doesn't taste anything like I mean this'll be probably be home nearest to homemade but that.
PS19L|Mm.
PS19U|bright yellow stuff it doesn't taste like that at all.
PS19L|No.
PS19U|it's sort of very more of.
PS19L|Here.
PS19U|a subtle taste you know it need loads of ground almonds.
PS19L|Mm.
PS19U|just to make a small oh.
PS19L|That come off rather easily would you like my marzipan.
PS19U|Hmm well leave it there and I'll see how I go cos I've had one carrot and I sort of like I had your carrot and I'm putting mine quite rich though that's the thing I quite like that bit there cos that's like brown sugar erm.
PS19L|It's lovely.
PS19U|Carl started me on this he was into carrot cake for years and.
PS19L|Yeah.
PS19U|mm and it's similar to a cake we used to have when he used to love erm when we were engaged he introduced.
PS19L|That's another name for it int it apparently.
PS19U|Oh is it oh it was the same but it was taller and that sort of buttery cream that was all on top and that had nuts and things.
PS19L|Mm.
