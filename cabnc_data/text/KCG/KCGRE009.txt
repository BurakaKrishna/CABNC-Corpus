PS19V|Yeah.
PS19L|That'll be nice.
PS19L|on your travels.
PS19L|you ought to see underneath the fridge he does this in the kitchen and they've all gone under the fridge when you're at the top shop or any other places where the will you have a look on the cards in the window I'm looking for a slide you know but a smaller one for him for the garden for the summer really cos that's just about had it that one Cos you can only use them up to about four I would think cos other other than that they get a bit too big for them don't they he could do with a little slide in the garden.
PS19V|he will Christmas.
PS19L|I'd like to get it sorted out a bit for him really before the summer starts.
PS19V|It'll be ideal.
PS19L|Mm.
PS19V|if you can just fasten him in the back it'll be smashing won't it.
PS19L|Well there's the gate he can only go so far with the gate anyway so it won't really matter yeah yeah you ought to see all the pegs at the back of me fridge.
PS19V|Go and watch daddy bring the tree down Watch it Michael it's coming yeah oh you have got hiccups.
PS19L|He's had them quite a bit these last few days they seem to come like that don't they.
PS19V|Mm.
PS19L|Then he'll go a month probably.
PS19V|there we are it's down.
PS19L|Oh fence nearly came with it.
PS19V|it'll seem funny won't it to see that tree down.
PS19L|I do think it's lightened this room up though when you think it gone.
PS19V|Yeah I mean it's better when you took that one from down there wasn't it.
PS19L|Oh yeah.
PS19V|Yeah.
PS19L|yeah the only thing about having those others of course you can see through the windows but there's not a lot you can do about that John had a word with the bloke across the back there.
PS19V|Oh did he.
PS19L|about you know the garage.
PS19V|Yeah.
PS19L|So he said he'd got no objections to John moving it back.
PS19V|Oh well mm.
PS19L|we'll probably end up doing a bit to the garden this year as opposed to er you know going to we were gon na go down to Somerset in June weren't we.
PS19V|Mm.
PS19L|But that with things as they are we might as well just hang fire.
PS19V|Well it's no use spending money you haven't got is it.
PS19L|No well the thing is I mean you're talking of five or six hundred pounds.
PS19V|This is it.
PS19L|and if you can't replace it I mean we've booked we've booked through erm Au August anyway we're definitely going in August to Southport.
PS19V|and it might be a little bit cheaper for yourself than going all that way it certainly won't it certainly won't cost you as much to get there anyway.
PS19L|No well that's it int it so er if things are reasonable we might just go away for a long weekend or something go find us a place in Southport for a weekend.
PS19V|Yeah.
PS19L|but really I mean you need the odd week at home don't you really to sort of do bits to it you can't work and do it.
PS19V|Well I mean I'm not going away this year but it's not really bothered me an awful lot.
PS19L|No no.
PS19V|so.
PS19L|you can't.
PS19V|gone to erm oh I think I told you didn't I.
PS19L|Yeah.
PS19V|Gone to Windsor today.
PS19L|that's right.
PS19V|and a day Eastbourne tomorrow now that's a nice little break.
PS19L|Mm.
PS19V|just just a few hours like that.
PS19L|yeah.
PS19V|see some places you see go from Friday to Monday don't they.
PS19L|That's alright I think that's ideal.
PS19V|Yeah.
PS19L|I think it's a good time to spend in the garden to be honest I mean you can't you can't it's not really long enough to try and do it at weekends not if he wants to move that garage back it'll probably take the best part of the week to sort that out.
PS19V|Oh it will yeah cos you've got to empty it and.
PS19L|That's right.
PS19V|move your swing haven't ya and.
PS19L|yeah.
PS19V|everything yeah and prepare the ground.
PS19L|Yeah I don't know whether that swing will end up going to the tip if it comes down it's a bit rusty int it Seen better days.
PS19V|Just depends if the frame's strong.
PS19L|Yeah.
PS19V|you know you could always put a bit of paint on it.
PS19L|mm.
PS19V|to stop the rust it just depends if it's strong enough to hold them the frame.
PS19L|mm it's done well though I mean.
PS19V|You might you might get a little something out of it for Michael.
PS19L|Mm we haven't got a seat on it.
PS19V|Oh dear.
PS19L|I don't know what happened to that one that granddad made Deana I know.
PS19V|is John going to the tip with all this tree.
PS19L|Mm me broke as well.
PS19V|Oh God.
PS19L|it's alright having two you never get two for twelve months.
PS19V|Oh.
PS19L|it's erm it's not too bad this time of year you can peg out the legs come off it you know that brown one that you bought me.
PS19V|Yeah.
PS19L|I mean I've had it since I remember getting washing me nappies and putting them on there.
PS19V|Oh I bought that one when Deana was a baby.
PS19L|Yeah it was before Deana was born.
PS19V|was it before Deana was born.
PS19L|Yeah cos I remember I was doing hang all me nappies out.
PS19L|before she was born so I washed them all and put them on.
PS19V|Did ya.
PS19L|Yeah so that was er eleven years ago aren't ya.
PS19V|Yeah.
PS19L|And it's been used constantly so it's not done bad it's the way the leg's been wiggly for a while it just broke off the other day so I don't know whether John can mend it he couldn't seem to think he can.
PS19V|No they're not er I've got one that's got a rivet come out.
PS19L|Mm.
PS19V|on this side you know where the little piece that that bend that you uncatch it to fold it up.
PS19L|I know what you mean yeah.
PS19V|the rivet's come out.
PS19L|Yeah.
PS19V|and that I find that very awkward I've got a rubber band round it at the moment.
PS19L|yeah.
PS19V|but you see that only lasts so long they they perish.
PS19L|yeah done well I might re come winter I'll probably replace it I won't bother now it's not worth it with summer says she having a nice summer.
PS19V|Yes well we're bound to have something aren't we.
PS19L|Well I should think so.
PS19V|We're bound to have something.
PS19L|We live in hope don't we.
PS19V|Yeah.
PS19L|What are you doing Mind you don't your tongue with that I tell you what they had in er Woolies market as well I don't know whether you've seen them and I don't I've not got you know an old Argos catalogue to compare prices cos they've not got it in the summer one but they have them in the winter ones it's like a a tool box but it's on wheels and you make it up you you know all the screws and the wheels come out and you're not it's all plastic I think it must be from age three because of the little bits and it's like erm I've seen it somewhere where I've been it has little figures sat in this erm what would you it's like erm a bit like a truck yeah and it's got the the figures in it.
PS19V|I haven't I haven't actually seen one but I once saw a lady on the bus with one.
PS19L|if it on the bus you can see.
PS19V|it's quite a big thing isn't it.
PS19L|Yeah yes.
PS19V|Yeah.
PS19L|on the box you can see it made up and then with all the bits and pieces separate.
PS19V|Mm.
PS19L|and I think it was something like say twenty pound it was on the market but I have a feeling it was something like thirty odd.
