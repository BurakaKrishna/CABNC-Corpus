PS1A9|Again.
PS1AA|Yeah but he said you know is that your mum there I said no it's not and then say the place Just on the other side Well should have been really taking two of her strong tablets she says you know and she has.
PS1A9|Oh dear.
PS1AA|She thinks it's because she was carrying Gemma.
PS1A9|Oh yes.
PS1AA|Yeah On that side.
PS1A9|Yeah.
PS1AA|It sounds like a.
PS1A9|Oh dear.
PS1AA|She went to see chiropractors you know when.
PS1A9|Yeah Oh heck And that is bad news What did she mention anything about the card.
PS1AA|No I didn't.
PS1A9|And didn't you.
PS1AA|No I'm not having it er she didn't do the when she said to me I want to speak to you about it she said you know she wasn't involving me at all was she.
PS1A9|No I'm thinking of writing myself you know to Karen.
PS1AA|Oh no you can't do that.
PS1A9|I I can.
PS1AA|Because I don't mind if Karen writes and bloody blames us that it's our bloody fault I'm not bothered.
PS1A9|No I just feel that er.
PS1AA|You don't wan na do that.
PS1A9|I mean we.
PS1AA|It'll upset her that.
PS1A9|she's obviously er very upset and I I mean I just don't want that she's such a nice girl You know like I really don't I I just thought perhaps a note from me you know apologizing.
PS1AA|Why not get a note from Karen apologizing for being a I had the hump.
PS1A9|Yeah I thought well a note from both of us really.
PS1AA|Well I don't think she and she Karen wouldn't want that because well it it's nothing to do with us Is it We're sticking our er oar in where we shouldn't And so the other he's there if you want isn't he I mean.
PS1A9|Well I know that.
PS1AA|You can't stick your oar in like that to her at any old time can you really.
PS1A9|No.
PS1AA|Well you could have stuck you know seven or eight years of age you couldn't even do it then in case it hurt the kid's mother or something like that or whatever it was She's nearly an adult Well and truly Getting an old man now never mind.
PS1A9|Well I know that I know but.
PS1AA|Well it's it's not our it's not our er we'll be just sticking our nose in where it's not necessarily wanted.
PS1A9|Yes but it was our mistake in the first place.
PS1AA|Well it wasn't really was it Obviously I mean I know you're arguing with her but er but if he'd if he'd have go if we got a christian name that night it wouldn't have gone down as either of those Karen or Fran.
PS1A9|I know well we could have found out quite easily.
PS1AA|Oh aye That's a different story Yes We could have found out We could have phoned Amy and found out there and then virtually but I think we said oh I summat like i i it's not worth bothering about don't matter just put.
PS1A9|But it did matter didn't it.
PS1AA|It did matter but we didn't know that at the time did we.
PS1A9|Oh no we didn't.
PS1AA|It'll be worse now in retrospect it'll worse phoning Amy up at that moment and asking what the name was And he could have put it down while he was here Cos he didn't know the name that night.
PS1A9|Oh I know he didn't I know that But the thing was what I what I was ge getting to last night is that we didn't bring the name into it the surname Get out.
