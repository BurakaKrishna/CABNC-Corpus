PS1A9|Graham Sounness I mean he's only thirty eight.
PS1AA|Could have gone any time with with nothing through his bloody arteries.
PS1A9|Good God But that's incred I didn't know it was that bad.
PS1AA|It was in the paper this morning And er.
PS1A9|Goodness me.
PS1AA|Well he's a he he didn't smoke.
PS1A9|No He was an athlete.
PS1AA|He's been an athlete He obviously ate like everybody else.
PS1A9|Mm And he.
PS1AA|I mean.
PS1A9|wasn't overweight in any way.
PS1AA|Wasn't overweight what more.
PS1A9|No.
PS1AA|the bloody hell do you have to do.
PS1A9|That's incredible that.
PS1AA|See they say it was a ma it's hereditary.
PS1A9|Well.
PS1AA|Cos his father had a bypass didn't he.
PS1A9|Oh did he.
PS1AA|I think some other relative died er.
PS1A9|Oh.
PS1AA|youngish.
PS1A9|Yes Oh well I bet I think perhaps it is really I know.
PS1AA|It's still going.
PS1A9|I know Yeah and you can't you can't understand it can you really Well look at the old lady that walks past here at ninety one.
PS1AA|That's right yeah Yeah.
PS1A9|And she does all her own shopping.
PS1AA|Mm.
PS1A9|You know I mean she keeps stopping but she's she's remarkable She really is.
PS1AA|Mm.
PS1A9|But they're few and far between aren't they When th you're like that.
PS1AA|Yeah.
PS1A9|Mm.
PS1AA|But what I couldn't understand with this Soun this fella that.
PS1A9|This Sounness.
PS1AA|Aye He he found out cos he went for to for a check up and they took his blood pressure.
PS1A9|Yes.
PS1AA|And tha well lots of people go and have blood pressure taken they find it's high and they.
PS1A9|Yes.
PS1AA|give them tablets.
PS1A9|Yes.
PS1AA|Go home Why did they take it a stage further with him He'd got high blood pressure he wasn't in any pain he's living a normal life Similar to what I was when I went.
PS1A9|Yes.
PS1AA|And they just give me tablets.
PS1A9|Yes.
PS1AA|Now why what made them take it to the stage.
PS1A9|Well er well first.
PS1AA|where he wanted a heart bypass.
PS1A9|first and foremost he was in a private scheme.
PS1AA|Well pro probably that's it then.
PS1A9|Yeah A and probably because i because of his father and er the rela the other relative having the bypasses done So they took it.
PS1AA|Mm.
PS1A9|a step further but I think probably it's because he was in er er a private scheme.
PS1AA|Very likely in n it.
PS1A9|Yes.
PS1AA|So there's a lot of people walking about with just taking bloody tablets who probably really should have a by bypass.
PS1A9|Ah well I well I wouldn't say that really Gordon I mean I think er when your blood pressure was found out and you'd been taking tablets ever so I think it's kept it all under control and you've you we eat a sensible diet The only the only er thing I complained about with you is is the butter.
PS1AA|Mm I don't have that much now.
PS1A9|But I think everything in moderation but you don't eat as much butter now as what you used to.
PS1AA|I don't eat that much bread you see.
PS1A9|No So I I think really and I think what I think with him I think definitely I think it must be the private scheme and plus that his own family it runs in the family.
PS1AA|Mm mm Must be hell of a shock being told.
PS1A9|Oh God It must have been See how much it's costing Two hundred and fifty pounds a night.
PS1AA|Yeah.
PS1A9|Phworgh That's without the operation.
PS1AA|Yeah Well he earned three hundred and fifty thousand a year then.
PS1A9|Oh I know And plus he's he he he he married an heiress you know.
PS1AA|Did he.
PS1A9|Er him er sh they live in Spain now Oh er he he's worth a pretty penny is Sounness He went in Carl's shop the other the other week.
PS1AA|Did he.
PS1A9|Yes Mm Must have been looking for a house Carl said he he looked er well er his face did it were very he's got a very poxy skin.

PS1AA|Mm.
PS1A9|having it done today.
PS1AA|It is indeed.
PS1A9|We I wonder how quick they would have got him in though if he wouldn't have been in a private scheme.
PS1AA|He could wait six months couldn't he.
PS1A9|Well he could have been dead by then.
PS1AA|Well er yeah e exactly that's what they're moaning about int it.
PS1A9|Terrible.
PS1AA|Put them on a list and wait I've never heard so much talk about health as we do nowadays.
PS1A9|Oh I know.
PS1AA|When I was young I co I don't remember talking all the time about bloody health and what you should do and what you shouldn't do.
PS1A9|No I know.
PS1AA|Did you.
PS1A9|No But we weren't educated in in in health though.
PS1AA|We just li we just lived and that was the end of it.
PS1A9|Yes but then you see in the ol in the old days Gordon I mean you we you were very fortunate if you got three meals a day and i and whatever you got you were glad of and used to eat it all Now we're much more affluent and people are educated we er.
PS1AA|Mm.
PS1A9|as regards their health.
PS1AA|Mhm.
PS1A9|Well th having said that Gordon your mother lived to a good old age and my mum and my father did.
PS1AA|Yeah.
PS1A9|And they ate all the wrong stuff didn't they.
PS1AA|According to wha according to what they say now they did.
PS1A9|Mm I know Don't know who to believe really.
PS1AA|When you look at when you look at the some all these a lot of these composers and artists who died long ago and you look the birth range there's a hell of a lot at seventy five seventy six.
PS1A9|Yes.
PS1AA|a oh there's a few at forty odd.
