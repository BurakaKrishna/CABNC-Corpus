PS1AG|Yeah Yeah it was good.
PS1A9|It was good.
PS1AG|I know what i i I suppose it is a good case though And close to the end a few people that were hanged a are innocent But I think if you did bring back hanging it'd cut out some of these flaming crimes.
PS1A9|I do as well.
PS1AG|You know I mean for all the.
PS1AA|Well there should be some.
PS1AG|if.
PS1AA|degrees of it shouldn't there.
PS1AG|I mean if if it means that th th there's less there's less people murdered or whatever then I know it sounds easy to.
PS1A9|Yeah but if you're one of the innocent ones.
PS1AG|I know I said that to Kevin if you're part of the family.
PS1A9|Yeah.
PS1AG|of the innocent.
PS1A9|It's.
PS1AG|one.
PS1A9|very difficult It was funny case though Hanratty weren't it Because sh I mean she was a eye witness and she picked him out.
PS1AG|I know but she picked the wrong one out at first.
PS1A9|At first.
PS1AG|So.
PS1A9|yes but er you can understand the confusion really I don't know really I have very mixed feelings about it.
