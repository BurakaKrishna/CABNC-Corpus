PS09T|There's this old girl at er the top of the road you know got them she planted them half way down her garden right when they'd grown to about six foot high she said we could have the rest of their garden so we did that's how come our garden's so big cos people give our give us the garden.
PS09U|Mm.
PS09T|Council come round our house they'll say yeah your garden looks big.
PS09U|If you can't plant them closer together instead of their roots going outwards they'll probably go downwards.
PS09T|Oh er.
PS09U|Yeah might do there must be a reason why they say plant nineteen inches apart.
PS09T|Of all the hedges I've seen they've been about eighteen two foot about that far apart.
PS09U|I'll have a look see how far ours are apart in the garden.
PS09T|yes and they've put in there and they're about two foot apart.
PS09U|Could be ages to grow like that now it's grown a real good hedge in fact no it ain't a good real hedge it's got massive great gaping holes in it.

PS09T|One of those aluminium greenhouses.
PS09U|they cost a lot of money they do.
PS09T|Mm I know that's why I was.
PS09U|cos it's made out of aluminium and you've got to put the glass in it's really expensive I tell you.
PS09T|Mm.
PS09U|No sheds are pretty expensive as well they're a couple of hundred quid aren't they.
PS09V|My mate used to fix sheds the garden sheds had this little card with Chad on it said what no shed.
PS09U|I remember that record this morning let's think.
PS09V|Yeah fine I'll bring it tomorrow I even got it out.
PS09U|No I want the green I want the garden chair I was thinking of getting a big garden chair and stick it in one of those lean-to.
PS09U|and lean it up against the garden shed you know what I mean.
PS09T|Yeah.
PS09U|If a bloody greenhouse on it's own when they.
PS09U|seriously.
PS09T|When we had the gales a couple of years ago I was in the kitchen making a cup of tea and I could hear all this glass smashing and I went ooh what's going on and the wind whistled across the field it's all open field.
PS09U|Yeah.
PS09V|Yeah.
PS09T|it flies down their garden and in between the two houses it acts like a wind.
PS09T|and you get gale force winds blowing down there and of course I opened the back door and there were panes of glass flying past.
PS09V|No.
PS09T|Yeah swinging around us literally big panes of glass and they were flying down and as soon as they got away from the houses it opened up again they were crashing down all over my drive and all over the road out there.
PS09U|What were they from.
PS09T|From the greenhouse.
PS09U|Oh.
PS09T|Something fell in greenhouse and broke the pane to allow the wind to get into the greenhouse which is oh dear me as soon as the wind got into the greenhouse as I say blowing the other panes out.
PS09V|Yeah.
PS09T|and as soon as the panes been blown out it was such a force it was blowing them between two houses smashing on the road and in the end once a few more panes had gone that was it the whole greenhouse I sat there watching this greenhouse it just suddenly launched itself off the bit on it over our fence it went there was glass everywhere for weeks afterwards when I was cutting the lawn oh dear the.
PS09T|glass shattered.
PS09U|I'm not surprised glass is really expensive now.
