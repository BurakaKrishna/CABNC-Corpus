PS09V|Yeah.
PS09T|they're a danger to life aren't they.
PS09V|Yeah it's terrible really.

PS09V|All raving about Rob Jones.
PS09T|down again.
PS09V|yep afraid so can you.
PS09T|get wound up.
PS09V|I know would wouldn't surprise me either.
PS09T|Pity you know.
PS09V|He said that's half the reason that Brian Tolbrook took over at Tettron ain't it I think he had his eyes he'd got his eyes on Tettron replacing.
PS09T|Yeah.
PS09V|in the league.
PS09T|he probably looked into the future a bit and decided that er.
PS09V|yeah.
PS09T|well it cost them a hundred thousand to do it but I mean he's never been able to afford the.
PS09T|yeah and he's deciding that Adam and he's deciding that Adam weren't worth it and.
PS09V|Yeah.
PS09T|went for it but.
PS09V|well he apparently spoke to erm he had quite a lengthy conversation with Ron Atkinson apparently cos Atkinson used to be the manager of Tettron didn't he And he was telling them you know what a a good club it could be it's the ground.
PS09V|they opened their own ground as well you see but that was.
PS09V|and I mean don't he's upset that.
PS09V|a wound up I mean if there was a league team like Kettering Kettering like the fourth division that would be brilliant be nearer to go wouldn't it.
PS09T|Why they all have such a large ground.
PS09V|I've never seen it.
PS09T|I remember going there.
PS09V|bet it's got four star pitches.
PS09T|after the war and there.
PS09T|and they had a record gate.
PS09V|It isn't a ground.
PS09T|near a ten near the ground size of Kettering's.
PS09V|but they've got to I remember when Rhys played in that the F A bars quarter final two seasons ago down here they got well over a thousand down there then and you just couldn't move that were brilliant all the way round the ground there were about four of five people deep.
PS09T|there's.
PS09T|ground it's a shame because.
PS09T|no point for promotion and weren't allowed to go off cos of the state of the ground.
PS09V|I know that.
PS09V|but they could win the league this this season and not go up.
PS09T|That's right.
PS09V|The Taylor reports got a lot to answer for really.
PS09T|How did they get on yesterday.
