PS09T|He said there were three er down there canvassing for the main parties and er well quite a lot of people there and of course rich pickings for providing they can get anybody to stop and talk to them don't know they'd drive around.
PS09U|I expect so this is that.
PS09U|said that people are losing all interest in the election and they've got no faith in any of parties they all seemed to much alike and all fund ranges.
PS09T|well er in a in a sense it it's it it been known since.

PS09T|And you're only still a village.
PS09U|Yeah.
PS09T|yeah but it's a a fair size down but er Middleton I've never been there I don't know where it is but it must be near Corby that worth finding on the er map.
PS09U|What.
PS09T|We can find it on the map.
PS09U|Yes I expect so.
PS09T|To tell you the truth I've never heard of it.
PS09U|No.
PS09T|I just think that there weren't many small villages in Northamptonshire that er well I didn't hear of if you know I didn't know of even if I hadn't visited them but erm.
PS09U|Wonder if she'll be staying in Wellingborough at least she'll have to travel.
PS09T|Pardon.
PS09U|a lot to this constituency during the next few weeks won't she.
PS09T|Did she what.
PS09U|I wonder whether she would be staying in Wellingborough or.
PS09T|No telling how she's got to we all obviously she has to.
PS09U|Well these days in a car it's not many minutes drive is it.
PS09T|Yeah no no.
PS09U|from Corby and Wellingborough.
PS09T|makes several.
PS09T|unless we get a usual three inches of wet snow and that'll stop everything you never know do you There's one thing a man.
PS09U|No snow now.
PS09T|Pardon.
PS09U|Hope we've finished with the snow now.
PS09T|But there's one thing you've got to.
PS09T|I've said to many years now about English weather in a sense it's it it it's got a something of endearing quality you don't like going through the bad weather but the fact is that we do get generally good weather.
PS09U|Yeah.
PS09T|at times.
PS09T|well there's so many areas in the world where they get lots and lots of er.
PS09U|Yes you know you know what the weather's going to be like.
PS09T|Well you know what it's going to be like it's sort of a set piece each each season.
PS09U|Yeah.
PS09T|but er you can't say that er the British are.
PS09U|well we can do that we had some lovely spring that day we went up to the park it was what spring like weren't it.
PS09T|Oh yeah.
PS09U|Now it feels cold again.
PS09T|It were March February too weren't it.
PS09U|That's right.
PS09T|Yeah fantastic.
PS09U|the snowdrops there.
PS09T|you know I remember ever so clearly when I worked down the Totexas Dentons.
PS09U|Mm.
PS09T|all those years back in the late fifties were it.
PS09U|It was the fifties yeah.
PS09T|I was down there in the late fifties.
PS09U|it was nineteen forty nine.
PS09T|and I remember one particular February it will always stand out in my mind because er it's a fairly long walk done to the factory from from here and every day after the midday meal when I set out to walk down there as quick as I could it had been cloudy since it was raining every day without fail I used to get to work soaked first.
PS09U|What February used to be sort of reckoned for rain didn't it.
PS09T|Yeah.
PS09U|The way the way they talk about March winds it was February rain they.
PS09T|well.
PS09T|you see first in.
PS09U|yeah.
PS09T|when I got there several times he used to scruffle into the er packing room and come out with those two three of those well a couple of those large sheets of brown paper that they pack yeah pack the few boxes in.
PS09T|and I'm not used to that shove them up.
PS09U|and but but.
PS09T|shove them up their trousers and pull the trousers up expose the leg and wrap round paper around and that was a amazing.
PS09U|was that keep.
PS09T|and it dried the trousers out and dried the leg and it were lovely and cosy after.
PS09T|half an hour or so.
PS09U|backward a bit when you walked.
PS09T|Aye it did but.
PS09T|it were a it were a efficient way of er getting dry mm and the next day there would of.
PS09T|this evening.
PS09U|Does what.
PS09T|I wondered if David had got this evening to catch a bottle of wine.
PS09U|Perhaps not.
PS09T|could be the two of them they just when er when Lee set out on a Saturday evening with er Kevin and they often sit there and er have a er a bit of a snack supper light supper and er.
PS09U|Well although you get a.
PS09U|in the evening anyway don't you.
PS09T|Yeah but a lot of the time.

PS09T|Derby and Joans pair.
PS09T|how old is Wendy Is she older than David.
PS09U|Wendy she's just a little bit older than David.

PS09T|Ah oh I didn't realize she was.
PS09U|unless she was she's quite a bit older than Dave.
PS09T|at least she's older but er not to that extent.
PS09U|I wasn't very happy about it at the time anyway I was her being I think he was only when were they married Seventy three the end of seventy three and he was twenty twenty two wasn't it they were married She'd already been married and divorced and she was quite a bit older than him and I I wasn't very happy about it to start but they seem to have settled down alright.
PS09T|Well she's made David a good wife actually.
PS09U|Well they've never had any more youngsters go.
PS09T|Told me she actually told me once that she considered herself lucky to er have met David I reckon she did because er she she was divorced then and er of course didn't she have a son.
PS09U|She has got a son yeah I don't think she sees him much now he did come here to.
PS09U|that she sees much of him he's er about twenty or more now.
PS09T|Yeah I was surprised that er Kathleen is it when Kathleen told us down street about her her son.
PS09U|He went in the army.

PS09T|I well you can go through the cemetery yes you can go through there.
PS09U|Well I didn't know where it was near a path.
PS09T|and then you go.
PS09U|well is it likely to be in the.
PS09T|you go in at the top of.
PS09U|the church is.
PS09T|top of the road what road's that running off from er High Street South.
PS09U|Mm yeah.
PS09T|can't remember.
PS09U|Stones Lane I'd got used to Manners Lane they call it something quite.
PS09U|since they've built up there Mannings Mannings Street or Mannings.
PS09T|You you put down that you.
PS09T|escape there and.
PS09U|yeah.
PS09T|and that's the best way it'll er oh you'll save ten minutes easy it's a fair walk it on the main road.
PS09U|I was hoping when they got that link road through they might connect up but I don't suppose it sort of roads got ta put parking towards the long piece of.
PS09T|Oh no it won't be a.
PS09U|major road.
PS09T|it's just.
PS09T|no I'm afraid there'll be no footpath there in fact it hurts me a bit that because they're cutting straight they're cutting along in line with that pub public.
PS09U|Yeah.
PS09T|footpath.
PS09U|One thing if they.
PS09T|it's nothing wrong with.
PS09U|if they put a cycle path along the edge of each road when they build them.
PS09T|No they're not as sensible as they are you remember in Prestley when we went there so what er perhaps especially for solid places solid with the roads in Germany.
PS09U|Oh in Germany yes there's.
PS09U|you've got priority there.
PS09U|statue and cross over.
PS09T|I mean it it's incredible in.
PS09T|we we went to we travelled about a bit while we were there went into Holland and er came via through Belgium and Holland just to get there and look how tidy.
PS09U|But before we went down into the.
PS09T|the towns were.
PS09U|tried to borrow a bike for us so that we could bike round but when she.
PS09T|Oh.
PS09T|she probably failed to er look.
PS09U|it's not as if there's anywhere where you can hire a bike I'm sure you know but I suppose you're going along on the road across the road I.
PS09T|course that's that's the beauty of er biking it up the hill that's some there's so much scope for not being on the road you've got special baths for someone.
PS09U|Yeah.
PS09T|the only one I want to know in this area is a you can.
PS09U|the one between the.
PS09T|that's it.
PS09U|they put that there when they built that new school.
PS09T|they did that for the school children.
PS09U|so that the.
PS09U|children could find the school.
PS09T|yeah and that's the only one I know of it's incredible to me either.
PS09U|Is it raining again.
PS09T|No it could do in a moment or two though it er it looks a bit ominous you rub one or two er doubts they are similar colour to these actually.
PS09U|Is that that the first one that's opening a creamy coloured one.
PS09T|Yes oh this Ellerdor is er playing around a bit now.
