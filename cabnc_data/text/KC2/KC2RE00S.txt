PS09Y|are you taking yourselves somewhere.
PS09U|I'm going now.
PS09U|But I used to like my little Hillman Imp.

KC2PSUN|mine's only it's only a you know about nine hundred and sommat C C engine.
PS09W|No I don't like big cars but I.
PS09U|I like a car where I'm in charge.
PS09W|Well if I tell you if I thought if I thought for one minute that we were gon na come back to England like in the next year which we won't cos Tony's got another year to do now it's a bit longer than we thought it was.
KC2PSUN|Mm.
PS09W|but if I thought we were coming back I'd get myself a little car You know I I can't drive that big.
PS09W|Well I can I mean I can move it and I can make i but I I don't.
PS09W|don't like it It's too big for me I like it being a passenger oh I don't like driving and the wheel's on the wrong side.
PS09Y|Are you getting used to the opposite side of the road now It's easy.
PS09T|Yeah Yeah.
PS09X|When you think it's nearly two years since I've been here.
PS09T|Yeah yeah it is in n it.
PS09X|Last time we came home we we came off the motorway and And wrong side of the road so chap coming round met us.
PS09T|It is confusing yeah It is confusing that is Oh well I opposite side of the road's nothing to me now cos I I live on my bike I'm always on me bike We came out the out the ferry port and you're alright going straight on to the boat it's when you've got ta turn right Very easy to simply turn into this lane instead of going right the way over to the other side.
PS09Y|Yeah.
PS09W|You do it without thinking That's where I fall down straight away.
PS09Y|Mm.
PS09W|When I'm on me bike I'll be down there in front of them cars.
PS09W|And we've got right of way now.
PS09Y|why they don't change over in this country because we're the odd one out and if they make cars they've got ta make them with the steering wheel one side or the other.
PS09U|Well yeah but think of the chaos it would cause swapping over.
KC2PSUN|Yeah.
PS09U|ooh think of the chaos it would cause.
PS09Y|What you need cos I remember reading about when they changed over I think it was in Denmark or somewhere.
PS09U|Eh.
PS09Y|and at a certain time everything stopped All the traffic it was all sort of er arranged that at a certain time all the traffic stopped to the other side.
PS09X|To to change this the British road system to the same as the continent would be easy You take away all the road.
PS09Y|It would be easier for the car manufacturers wouldn't it.
PS09T|That's it yeah.
KC2PSUN|Yeah.
PS09Y|have to make cars with the steering wheel one side or the other.
PS09W|Well I think it would be ideal.
PS09U|take away the roundabouts.
PS09W|I I think.
PS09U|Roundabouts are better off.
PS09X|congestion.
PS09W|but I mean.
PS09U|No way No way.
KC2PSUN|I prefer them traffic lights I do.
PS09X|No they're no good.
PS09U|Prefer them to traffic lights.
PS09X|Well over there you see we don't get many traffic lights.
PS09W|You don't get many traffic lights or roundabouts.
PS09X|Although in Germany.
PS09W|amazing roads You don't see any cars.
PS09X|three or four roundabouts.
PS09U|Well you see i i yeah but it's a bigger country and I mean it's so congested in England You've got ta have some sort of.
PS09X|Even in town you don't have roundabouts.
PS09U|traffic control haven't you.
PS09X|Well there's no roundabouts in the town.
PS09T|It's all filtered in n it.
PS09X|It's all filtered on.
PS09T|Mm.
PS09U|Yeah but I mean I suppose it's what you're used to.
PS09X|got priority.
PS09W|I couldn't believe.
PS09Y|Well when was there that fortnight and it seemed ever so strange when we car with the driver sitting that side and all the traffic coming by the other way it seemed mad to me cos of just those few weeks I didn't get time to get.
PS09U|Ah no.
PS09Y|acclimatized to it.
PS09W|You'll have to come longer I told you you should come longer.
PS09Y|Mm.
PS09W|You'll have to come longer.
PS09V|It's it's it's a thing that could be done in this country.
PS09X|It needs it.
PS09U|Yeah but when wh.
PS09V|But er it would cause chaos for a time.
PS09W|Yeah.
PS09V|especially with pensioners.
PS09W|Oh yeah it would.
PS09U|Right I'm gon na go.
KC2PSUN|But not only that but you there'd be a point where.

PS09V|Yeah.
PS09X|you know I needed a rest when I got back.
PS09V|And it's a strain.
PS09X|It is you know.
PS09V|Especially these days on these roads.
PS09X|Yeah.
PS09V|Well.
PS09X|Yeah.
PS09V|And they er adopted a scheme last year when they cut off part of the high street from traffic.
PS09X|Mm.
PS09V|And you went down the high street and you turned sharp left and went along Dock Street and circling supermarket at the bottom end of town.
PS09X|That's right yeah Yeah.
PS09V|They've cut that out now.
PS09X|Oh.
PS09V|You go straight down again And consequently the the high street uncertain now.
KC2PSUN|Ooh.
PS09X|Yeah.
PS09V|And they're all doing their shopping.
PS09X|I'm er I'm a believer in er pedestrian precincts you know Because if you want to do shopping or just window shopping you should park outside of the town or on the outskirts of the town and you can walk in or you can get the the bus service.
PS09V|Yeah yeah yeah.
PS09X|It's just as easy.
PS09V|But that's the problem bus service.
PS09X|Well yeah.
PS09V|in this country today the.
PS09X|Well it isn't a bus service is it you know.
PS09V|No.
PS09X|Because you feel obliged to them don't you Providing a service.
PS09V|been destroyed.
PS09X|Yeah.
PS09V|I think the best move they made in in in recent years has been the introduction of what they call the and it travels all the way in the town And forty pence you can get on and go up to your home they pull up outside our gate.
PS09X|Yeah.
PS09V|And for forty pence.
PS09Y|It's been a godsend for us to go down the street shopping if you've got a load of shopping you just stop right outside the gate.
PS09X|Yeah They did that they did that in er yeah they did that in Levington with er.
PS09V|Yeah.
PS09X|taxis You got and you you a taxi came along and you paid him forty P or fifty P whatever.
PS09V|Mm.
PS09X|and you went anywhere on that route yeah And if you said you wanted to be off the route slightly no problem he'd go around.
PS09V|That's it Yeah.
PS09Y|It has it's routes it goes round and round.
PS09X|Yeah.
PS09Y|and you can go on it anywhere as far as you like for forty pence.
PS09V|And you can do the lot for forty pence.
PS09V|It even takes you over the hill into.
PS09Y|We can get down on the high street any of these times and it drops us back up here.
PS09V|Yeah.
PS09Y|It's a circular route all the time it keeps going back to the town centre.
PS09V|Yeah.
PS09Y|but it's ever so useful.
PS09V|Yeah I it's excellent It's superb for.
PS09X|Yeah.
PS09V|for pensioners But a lot of youngsters use it too.
