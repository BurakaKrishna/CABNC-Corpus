PS03S|r er Northampton and then finally I went to Rushden and er this top one and his mate come out of the toilet been for a smoke and er walking by I said hey Les look at this and I spun the cam round and it went bang and stopped dead He said well you've got no bloody springs on the pawls I says so I picked a tin of springs up we kept it for anybody who wanted a spring for their bike any spring where you know the hooks on each end.
PS03U|Mm.
PS03S|Well they broke off in wear and when you was overhauling a machine you'd throw these springs in the tin in case you ever wanted one And he said er oh he says er er there's no your spring's broke I s so I showed him this tin full I says well look they do break don't they Anyway do you know the easiest er and at that time five pound were five pound if I'd 've gone to the foreman and then the er.
PS03T|Drawing office.
PS03S|drawing office I'd 've got five pound on a suggestion Anyway in the fullness of time er went to er.
PS03T|You said that.
PS03S|near Kettering Don went to er Northampton and then finally I went to Rushden and er I'd been there about a year and all of a sudden there was a call in for Shorteners at so I went down on the bike and er what er the one over me who who was elderly well wasn't over me but he was er he was on my job but the senior man on it he come in the boss had sent him in to have a look cos the er Shorteners were complaining and er then they rang up for one of us he said well I'm not leaving till I've solved this problem so I had to go But er all he did was you know the two pawls that go in and out He made a bit of eight inch wire like er a U piece and the bar at bottom bar of the U held the tail so if the springs broke the tails didn't duck under and smash the cam It'd smashed the cam and and the lever and bent the shaft colossal expense at that time.
PS03U|Mm expensive.
PS03S|Now him and his mate says ooh er you your spring's broke Now I were bloody daft If I'd 've gone to the foreman and wanted to put a suggestion in I I I'd 've beat sure they were crowing abou when he got but I was first really wasn't I.
PS03T|Mm.
PS03S|I I'd seen it before it happened.
PS03T|Mm.
PS03S|you see and three more went like that eventually but er he got the dough and that was it.
PS03U|That was it mm.
PS03S|And Evelyn always says I'm too diffident to push my plate up and.
PS03T|Well he used to come home and say that and I'd say put a suggestion in but.
PS03U|Mm.
PS03V|Mm.
PS03T|if he did I had to write to out for him.
PS03V|Mm.
PS03T|Still we didn't do too badly Anyway how long have you got to go before you retire.

PS03T|Not staying longer.
PS03U|and it might end up.
PS03T|No no.
PS03U|There's certain rumours that there's no.
PS03T|Still you might get a a big redundancy pay out if you do.
PS03U|Well talking about a year's salary.
PS03T|Is that.
PS03U|You get a pension of course but it depends how many years.
PS03T|Yes you get a pension.
PS03U|you've been there and I've only been there thirteen years so.

PS03T|Well my friend never paid.
PS03S|Tal talking about pensions Tom the chap er cha with the office girls and that and and checking our expense sheets he he er they put a notice on the board you could ante your what in your pension you could a put a bit more into it and I were looking at notice and he says ooh he says it's no good for you he says er w well I told you about it didn't I.
PS03T|Yes And I said ooh.
PS03S|He said ooh he says you won't get no more if you retire So I mentioned it to Evelyn and being an office-wallah you know and any any e extra money she were all there she worked it out says ooh that it were another ten bob a week you see well we've been.
PS03T|Which was a lot in those days.
PS03V|Mm.
PS03T|Well you had a rise as well.
PS03S|we've been glad we've been glad now haven't we er.
PS03T|So he anted his up I mean ten shillings was a we a we was.
PS03V|Mm quite a lot yeah.
PS03T|years ago.
PS03S|Yes but we're glad now.
PS03T|Oh yes because now mind you the B U pension's quite good because every year we we get a p a percentage increase.
PS03U|Mm Mm.
PS03T|but I mean ours doesn't mine doesn't I mean mine's only a small one because I haven't done many years there.
PS03U|Ours goes cost of living it says.
PS03T|But er oh that's alright if it does but the B U is is you know a really good one.
PS03V|Mm.
PS03U|But you've got to get some years in to get a really good pension but I've got thirteen and the maximum you can get is forty years but you get then get two thirds of the salary you would have got.
PS03T|Mm.
PS03U|your own salary so that's pretty good for a pension isn't it You know.
PS03T|Still perhaps you get the earnings thing don't you Earnings related as well sort of thing.
PS03U|That's being stopped though.
PS03T|Has it.
PS03U|It's gon na be in the year two thousand they're gon na wipe it out.
PS03T|Oh oh.
PS03U|So that's it.
PS03T|Oh dear I'm not au fait with those things now.
PS03V|No well this is why w you know like my girls have got just to take their own now.
PS03U|Take their own private ones see.
PS03V|Yeah.
PS03T|Yeah my nieces are doing that Audrey and er well her husband's self employed so er.
PS03U|See all the firms I've been to up till the Gas Board just gave you your money back for your pension.
PS03T|Yes they did.
PS03U|If they could have said to you would you keep it and or transfer it t I would've said yes please.
PS03T|Well they can do now in those days they didn't.
PS03U|But they they could but they they didn't in my day they just.
PS03T|No.
PS03U|gave it to you back and you got no choice in the matter that was it.
PS03T|No they didn't no we didn't in our place.
PS03U|So that was a shame really as far as I'm concerned.
PS03S|Do you reckon the er.
PS03T|Mm Although Peter my friend's he he did that but er it didn't come to much they'd 've saved it or something one job cos he was made redundant about three times and er one one place he was at they're supposed to have kept it and paying him it now but I don't know how they came about that bu because actually they we played him a dirty trick they persuaded him to leave his job and then about nine years or probably less than that later you know and he was out again redundant and you know I think they felt a bit guilty but he only gets about five pounds a week from off that one which is.
PS03V|Nothing is it No.
PS03S|Er er do you reckon we ought to have had you kn you know we went over to gas I toyed with the idea of fetching that do you know you know when this house were built we went looking at a depot where they've got all these grates and I took th funnily enough I took the measurements of the breast and er the only one we found was just that dead on look right across.

PS03T|Oh that lady who came with this she said er Arthur happened to say he'd just bought it and she said how much did they charge you twenty five pounds or thirty pounds.
PS03U|Mm.
PS03T|So I said no only twenty So apparently she said ooh he probably charges perhaps if he's not very he reduces the price but funny she said twenty five pounds.
PS03S|She seemed to know about it.
PS03V|Yeah.
PS03S|And it's funny they came together and she she pushed.
PS03T|She knew not quite together.
PS03S|in while I were with the other chap.

PS03T|I thought perhaps he'd been to you and sort of were you interested and he he'd come back But it was only a second.
PS03T|No.
PS03T|after er sort of I'd more or less half a second and I thought oh he's come back again.
PS03S|But but I had more to do with her than Evelyn but er from what little bits I've gleaned you know er I'm a bit into everything like and I seem to think I've got a f strange feeling that she's something to do with education and they're worried about children not speaking properly eventu.
PS03T|No.
PS03S|Le let me finish Er eventually they won't speak real English with all this Asian kids in now al all the Asian children have got ta go in any school haven't they and th everything well sooner or later er this mixture of languages is gon na spoil the English language isn't it Bound to.
PS03U|Yes it's bound to.
PS03T|No what the they'll do they'll put all the words that are used into a computer er from all these things won't they And then they'll see how many are sort of used a lot and percentage and that's what they'll do.
PS03U|Mm But as Arthur says though perhaps some of the Asian words will start being used by the English people.
PS03T|Oh oh yes yes Well it says on the on the thing we have to fill in er if any of the speakers is of non.
PS03S|Non ra er non English yeah.
PS03T|English or something a different race if you like you're to put it down Because you only have to identify them by a name not not a.
