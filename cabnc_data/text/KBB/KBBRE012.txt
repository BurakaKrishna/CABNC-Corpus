PS03T|oh that's why you bought the big board.
PS03S|yeah I know but I.
PS03T|you know where your drawing pins are.
PS03S|I tried it but the paper was stuck down stuck down already.
PS03T|look there's the drawing pins.
PS03S|mm leave them there though.
PS03T|out in this cupboard.
PS03S|mm.
PS03T|I should like something nice to finish off with.
PS03S|take your skirt of then.
PS03T|don't be silly.
PS03S|mm ain't that nice.
PS03T|no.
PS03S|I thought it was.
PS03T|do you want half this orange.
PS03S|I'll have a bit then if you're not gon na eat it.
PS03T|cos the big ones are too big big aren't they these are.

PS03S|how is it that were still.
PS03T|I've only just put it on.
PS03S|oh are they different oranges.
PS03T|no they're Morroc but they're.
PS03S|they are.
PS03T|but they're a bigger size and thicker skinned I'd sooner have the smaller ones.
PS03S|you don't see blood oranges now do ya.
PS03T|you do sometimes these are the best Morroc's but same the stall I go to doesn't stand on Tuesdays only Wednesdays and Fridays and Saturdays here are.
PS03S|don't get juice all over it.
PS03T|I shan't get juice all over every where it'll be you Well Made your Barbara's on at twoo'clock are you going to see that.
PS03S|mm I might as well.
PS03T|you've got to be quick though.
PS03S|what time now.
PS03T|it's nearly that now are you going to change.
PS03S|mm.
PS03T|mm you better they're your old trousers aren't they I mean.
PS03S|well with Clare and.
PS03T|look at all the pigeons again do you want to have a bit more nice aren't they sit up sit up these are juicy aren't they must still be very cold outside can you see the steam from the boiler.
PS03S|mm where was that fog on freezing roads.
PS03T|I'm glad we've got the cooker hood done you can see all that black.
PS03S|mm.
PS03T|can't never that filter to be like that have you.
PS03S|ah I've put you a three eight wide eight thick piece of steel lay it on the top that would hold it down in the middle.
PS03T|well those hack saw blades do don't they.
PS03S|mm just hold it down and.
PS03T|I mean I think so.
PS03S|that spring didn't work the one we had did it cos it.
PS03T|I think those springs are are dangerous they shoot up and down on.
PS03S|came flying out when out in't it when we put it in.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|now we know.
PS03T|I mean.
PS03S|it won't fly out when it's inside.
PS03T|that's what I mean as you were putting it in it it shot out didn't it.
PS03S|mm.
PS03T|last time Not much on these potatoes.
PS03T|I've not had any today just had one little bit do do you like'em.
PS03S|one thin strip of metal edge ways on across the centre I'd do it won't it that thing.
PS03T|would it.
PS03S|well you've got all the size pattern down.
PS03T|well your the expert.
PS03S|in that across.
PS03T|well that that spring you got was too thick.
PS03S|mm.
PS03T|too wide wasn't it it was wider than the the thing itself so you want it's got to be cut down width wise.
PS03S|you know how according to the thick the bull clip last time you had a lot of cause didn't ya.
PS03T|ah but on you know the new diagram the new packet the springs went like dia er.
PS03S|diamond.
PS03T|half a diamond shape.
PS03S|yeah what you really want is a.
PS03T|and on one side and yet inside the instructions it gave you know.
PS03S|mm.
PS03T|two curves.
PS03S|yes well I've been thinking about it what you want is a.
PS03T|well we paid about three pounds for those springs.
PS03S|springs.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|when do you ever buy.
PS03T|when we bought them when we had the first lot of springs.
PS03S|oh I we haven't got them now that's before.
PS03T|you must have must be in me diary.
PS03S|well any way look if I made you a thin bit of steel straight across the centre like that.
PS03T|yes that would.
PS03S|it's thicker than hack saw blade perhaps a bit heavier.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|straight across and then put a cross on the other way that's all you want.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|like that.
PS03T|mm I know.
PS03S|like hack hack saw blades sort of thing.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|edge ways on.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|not flat because you stop the air from to that simple enough.
PS03T|where you going to get the spring from.
PS03S|steel.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|oh I've got a load of that back of the car.
PS03T|Is this too hot with the fire on.
PS03S|no I'm alright.
PS03T|is that the boiler making that noise.
PS03S|yeah.
PS03T|seems to be louder than usual don't it.
PS03S|or it's your fan.
PS03T|I thought I'd turn the fan on.
PS03S|your fan.
PS03T|I know I thought I'd turned it off I'm going to have a look something seems to be making a noise it was the vent.
PS03S|yeah yeah.
PS03T|I'd put that on as well as the other fan.
PS03S|as the fan the fats congealed with the frost.
PS03T|what on the.
PS03S|you know in the opening and.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|the fans are catching it How what's the time now.
PS03T|nearly five too five too.
PS03S|oh.
PS03T|stop moaning you know what you didn't have.
PS03S|that there.
PS03T|your medicine before your meal that medicine you're supposed to take before for your chest.
PS03S|that's alright now it's not er it must of been er congealed in the night in the chest.
PS0YX|T is now.
PS03S|she won't agree.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|I the the disturbed at the way the English lads are speaking.
PS0YX|ooh without a doubt.
PS03S|in a way they find out.
PS03T|no I think that it's to get the vocabulary various classes of people and varies age group.
PS03S|yeah but as Les says there's more in it than that.
PS0YX|there's a there's of course the entire speaking.
PS0YX|is getting very bad now in't it.
PS03S|yes.
PS0YX|I brought those all Arthur erm.
PS03S|it's got ta be like that is it.
PS03T|they're the things that's got to fit in no they're not.
PS0YX|and now I think do they just clip on they just clip on.
PS03S|yes they well er see that step only there's erm.
PS0YX|yes I'll just have to stand up.
PS03S|I reckon there's another one the other side perhaps that they.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|only just drop on like that don't they.
PS0YX|yes and then the piece sticks out where you just er where it goes on.
PS03S|yeah.
PS0YX|so I don't how'll you how will you do it will you be alright to do it.
PS03S|yeah is it is this one alright is it is it only the one broken or two.
PS0YX|no there's two they're the two pins.
PS03S|they're these are all the bits.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|well there's only only enough bit then for I don't.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|that's why I shall come up and have a look at.
PS0YX|are yours.
PS03T|don't know.
PS0YX|that stuff what's clipped on yours with your pin.
PS03S|no I'll show you in a minute no.
PS0YX|or are they just er.
PS03T|here you are lets take these.
PS03S|what I think Les I think you should have two walls I don't know I think you should have two walls one either side.
PS0YX|yes ther ther there.
PS03S|then and that.
PS0YX|them split at the end.
PS03S|yes.
PS0YX|where it's on.
PS03S|er right.
PS0YX|see it's split.
PS03T|mind that might be hot.
PS03S|ooh.
PS03T|don't put it on the carpet if it's hot.
PS03S|there it is look.
PS03T|no that.
PS03S|see that spark.
PS03T|don't want sewing up.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|see were on a bit of a.
PS0YX|yes I move that metal that comes out and it's split.
PS03S|yeah well what.
PS0YX|is yours split there.
PS03S|no well what.
PS03T|don't stand on it.
PS03S|what I think is this.
PS0YX|oh I see yes I see.
PS03S|hold on a minute Les lets turn these off.
PS03T|mind your going to spray.
PS03T|lets move it away.
PS0YX|underneath in't it.
PS03T|oh we've got one of them light bulbs.
PS03S|oh things come out.
PS03T|to be replaced look one of'ems gone that's why it's dark.
PS03S|er used to any way that wants seeing er I reckon you should have see that lip.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|I reckon you should have another lip and it fits that slide on like that.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|so you'll I shall have to make one.
PS0YX|yes I wonder if er if you got two bits of thin tin you know.
PS03S|yeah well I and er.
PS0YX|make you.
PS03S|and er.
PS0YX|it just slides on I think.
PS03S|lower that and and you peg stones up like that.
PS0YX|that's right yes.
PS03S|see you can't go out cos that's er and er just pushes on I think.
PS0YX|yes cos the cos cos where's yeah.
PS03S|you see it's very fragile got a.
PS0YX|where it's come off.
PS03S|mm.
PS0YX|it's it's parted the the the the metal fang comes along and then when it gets to the end ere it's split it's split.
PS03S|I you know what that's for for the spring it's split like that in't it.
PS0YX|what yeah.
PS03S|it's split like that.
PS0YX|yes yes the metal yes and it.
PS03S|which is.
PS0YX|clips on there I think.
PS03S|well yeah you open that out to make it tight.
PS0YX|oh I to fasten it on.
PS03S|yeah.
PS0YX|I see.
PS03S|you see you get over the years it probably expands and it.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|becomes loose.
PS0YX|ah.
PS03S|so you open that a bit.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|that spring.
PS0YX|which is that yeah I.
PS03S|and then.
PS0YX|alright then.
PS03S|you'll have to push it on.
PS0YX|I got it yes.
PS03S|any way I'll make summat to do it.
PS0YX|right thank you you've got the two pins have ya.
PS03S|yeah yeah.
PS0YX|Arthur.
PS03T|Better find a little dish to put them on so you don't wa.
PS03S|well I've got plenty.
PS03T|loose them let me get a dish.
PS03S|I've got plenty of drivers like this.
PS0YX|have ya.
PS03S|yeah.
PS0YX|here's one here and you've got the other one ain't ya.
PS03S|used to drive erm our machine used to drive.
PS0YX|did they.
PS03S|what we call drivers.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|about two inch long you know.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|and er they are very fragile.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|they've made it so as it it do you see I I I reckon you ought to open my let me make them in te in steel because er they made them like that so that when you pull them off or adjust them.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|they won't burn ya.
PS0YX|no yes.
PS03S|I mean they're like er ha hard plastic.
PS0YX|it is in't it yes it's like it.
PS03T|what are ours.
PS03S|er well metal you see there look.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03T|well you don't you don't have to make it in plastic do you.
PS03S|well it does it its method is to shove them on.
PS03T|oh.
PS03S|er in or out according to where he wants them to flicker well you see as it as the wearing get hot that plastic expands and become loose and he's got a a split see that steel thing.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|ours is like that solid well his is split the idea that is you opened it like that so when you push your others on it has to compress it and it holds but over the years it's er the body.
PS0YX|weaked.
PS03T|the body.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03T|yeah.
PS03S|er er I can make you one in plastic.
PS03T|what.
PS03S|but er.
PS0YX|oh what oh I du n no know er.
PS03T|mm have you had it a few years.
PS0YX|ooh yeah about two the same one in the lounge and one in the in the dining room one's got the convector on.
PS03S|it depends don't it.
PS0YX|the top.
PS03T|mm.
PS0YX|and the two bars and the other one's got the two bars.
PS03T|mm.
PS0YX|yeah they're very good and er funny that one in each has gone.
PS03T|oh oh it's.
PS0YX|you see not the two yes so we've still got one lighting on each.
PS03T|my tubes have gone one out of each pack oh I see you've got one one er er out of each room.
PS0YX|that's right yes yeah yes.
PS03T|I just remembered one of these lights went last night.
PS0YX|did they.
PS03T|I forgot to remind Arthur to er.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03T|to replace it.
PS0YX|yeah yeah.
PS03T|get that one down.
PS03S|yes without go coming up to say and I presume it's like this you perhaps told when I draw it.
PS03T|don't draw on that table too much you'll mark the table.
PS03S|now that's your piece still I assume.
PS0YX|yes coming that way.
PS03S|that way.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|now this this is the matter now you your other bit I don't think your gon na see it mate.
PS03T|put that other lamp on Arthur.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03T|so you can see.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03T|is Eadie resting.
PS0YX|yes yes she'll just have an or orange when I came out she's been I've been getting a few of those it seems to help a bit.
PS03T|mm I always eat plenty of fruit.
PS0YX|yes yeah.
PS03T|Arthur does grapes.
PS0YX|does he.
PS03T|mm he loves grapes and apples.
PS0YX|er.
PS03T|we couldn't bring any apples though yesterday not taking me car with.
PS0YX|ah carrying yes.
PS03T|we get er.
PS0YX|how's the arm going Evelyn.
PS03T|well it's it's still swollen.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|oh her tempers getting the same Les.
PS0YX|yeah yeah yeah.
PS03T|but er I can turn taps and hold things a little bit more.
PS0YX|can you yes I well it's gon na take time for that.
PS03T|not not all that.
PS0YX|to go down in't it.
PS03T|as you you know how you sort of hold want to.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03T|hold things in your left hand.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03T|er it's still not very strong.
PS0YX|is it.
PS03T|no.
PS0YX|mm.
PS03T|but the swellings gone down mostly I've got gloves.
PS0YX|ooh it is it's a lot better yes quite a while.
PS03T|on for the first time yesterday.
PS0YX|Christmas yes yeah.
PS03T|so.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03T|I think I'll go.
PS03S|you can't draw it in yellow cos it don't er take on this so I'm going.
PS03T|you don't have to draw it in yellow.
PS0YX|no no I'll be alright now.
PS03S|if you do them both white it looks all wrong.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03T|but you've got different colour pencils.
PS03S|now this green is your your yellow.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|er there's a slit there ain't there like that keep this still.
PS0YX|yes that's right it's open yeah.
PS03S|well.
PS0YX|oh that's how how it works.
PS03S|now that's that's the wall of your yellows.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|broken.
PS0YX|that's right.
PS03S|and that's the other wall which you need to go.
PS0YX|yes as far as I can see with the other one's.
PS03S|yeah.
PS0YX|still on yes.
PS03S|yeah they now looking at end ways it's like this in't it.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|that's your your yellow plastic.
PS0YX|that's right it's just on the end.
PS03S|that's it now here's your steel bit that's split.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|like that.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|so if you open that er steel bit.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|wide like that.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|wider than what it is.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|it grips when you push it on.
PS0YX|that's right.
PS03S|and the idea that is is I see it.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|is you want.
PS0YX|so they will slot it won't they.
PS03S|yeah as I no no not the yellow the the metals slot in.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|and the idea is so you you push it down to earth you want it down to there.
PS0YX|in other words you can move it up and down aargh.
PS03S|and I reckon that's it that's broke on your movement you see.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|it's these walls have broken off there.
PS0YX|mm.
PS03S|see those two walls.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|and that's the bottom bit and that that there's your steel inside.
PS0YX|yes that's right.
PS03S|but these have broken off and of course it's dropped off.
PS0YX|I.
PS03S|so what I'll shall have to make you is a you can either have it in metal or in plastic.
PS0YX|whatever is is is easiest for you Arthur you're doing.
PS03S|well I think it's both easy but er.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|there it's done with plastic so it don't get red hot when you when you adjust it.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|but then again you'd be a bit daft.
PS03T|don't suppose you adjust it very often do ya.
PS03S|no but you'll be a bit.
PS0YX|never touched it I haven't.
PS03T|no.
PS03S|you'll be a bit daft to adjust it when it was hot wouldn't ya.
PS03T|mm yeah.
PS0YX|yes but I've never touched them er.
PS03S|if it was mine I'd er I'd er.
PS0YX|I've took these off to to put the bulbs in.
PS03T|mm.
PS03S|for my money I'd have it with all metal.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|but that's the i you see the idea of it now can't ya.
PS0YX|yes yes.
PS03S|your yellow bits slides along here to where they were here's your here's your point.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|you can have it there you can have it there you can have it there.
PS0YX|ah ah.
PS03S|by pushing it up and down.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|and this gets very hot well fairly hot.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|and the plastic soft and broke.
PS0YX|yes I think what I can see of er of what's on the other one on each fire.
PS03S|yeah.
PS0YX|er there right on the end.
PS03T|mm oh I see.
PS0YX|there right to the end.
PS03T|oh Arthur's all always messing about with ours.
PS0YX|is he.
PS03T|to sort of make them go round.
PS0YX|ah.
PS03T|you know unless there's a draft.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03T|they won't always flicker do they.
PS0YX|no no no.
PS03T|he likes fiddling about.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|I've made ours go right and left we've got two.
PS0YX|yeah I've never touched ours much at all.
PS03T|well he's only got on there's one out of each fire.
PS03S|oh we've got two and er.
PS03T|well so has Les got two.
PS03S|on the same fire.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03T|but there's one alright and one broken.
PS0YX|there's four altogether.
PS03S|yeah but oh four well I'd like to.
PS03T|yeah of course yeah.
PS03S|you you see those wings that are going round there.
PS0YX|yes yes.
PS03T|he's got two fires.
PS03S|these.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|I turn'em what that that way.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|and this one that way.
PS0YX|yeah.
PS03S|so that one goes to the right and this one goes to the left.
PS0YX|ah ha ha I've nothing never yeah.
PS03T|he he fiddles about with he likes fiddling.
PS0YX|he did tell me though about doing the old pencil in in here in't it.
PS03T|yes.
PS0YX|in here Arthur ain't it.
PS03T|or graphite.
PS03S|or a bit of graphite yeah.
PS0YX|you put the in there in there do ya.
PS03S|just put your.
PS0YX|in there.
PS03S|pencil just put your pencil in and along there.
PS0YX|yeah and roll it round I.
PS03S|yeah now here's your there's your peg look your pointer now draw it in black you can see it better there's your pointer now draw it out here the bit you brought your your yellow bit is like that.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|and if you if I make in steel and then can drive in and fit your pin.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|you'd have this effect see there's your wall and the that then you pin up the middle like that.
PS0YX|ah yes.
PS03S|you see but now that if that were metal and this is your other metal.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|you know what you say that's split.
PS0YX|yes where it's got ta go on.
PS03S|yeah got ta go on like that in't it.
PS0YX|yes.
PS03S|now for my money now if that were loose I'd open these.
PS0YX|shall.
PS03S|no.
PS03S|strip straight them open so that they're like that a bit instead er.
PS0YX|ah yeah.
