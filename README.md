# CABNC-Corpus
Utilities for Processing the [CABNC Corpus](https://ca.talkbank.org/access/CABNC.html) 
available from [TalkBank](https://talkbank.org/).
CABNC is a conversation analytic re-transcription of naturalistic conversations from a subcorpus of the British National Corpus
 and contains around 4.2 million words in 1436 separate conversations


## Scripts
cabnc_to_json.py script processes the 14 dialogues from the original .cha format into .json files using the format
outlined below.
This format is intended to facilitate annotation of the dialogue using the 
[Conversation Analysis Schema](https://nathanduran.github.io/CA-Schema/)
and [Dialogue tagger](https://github.com/NathanDuran/CA-Dialogue-Tagger).

cabnc_to_text.py processes the 14 dialogues from the original .cha format into plain text files,
with one line per-utterance, using the format outlined below.

cabnc_utilities.py script contains various helper functions for loading/saving and processing the data.

## Data Format
The original transcripts have had all disfluency and annotation characters removed. For example '|', 'â—‰', '=', '@'.
The metadata 'headers' have also been removed.

Any sentences that are continued on another line by the same speaker (marked with '+') have been
concatenated to form complete uninterrupted sentences.

Certain words, such as swear words or names, were redacted in the original transcripts and replaced with *'xxx'*.
These have been raplaced with an *\<unk\>* token.

### Example Text Format
ERI|didn't they, didn't you ever hear that they, they found an entire woolly mammoth, frozen.

JAC|yeah, and they ate it.

ERI|an entire one though.

JAC|yeah.
