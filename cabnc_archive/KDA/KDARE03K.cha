*PS1GF:	its not you ca n't the thing is you ca n't defend them without how you die you ca n't train people how to avo to die you can only train them how to avoid it so it does n't really matter if you get fired or not but they show you the drills and you have to do them to the best of your ability the blank rounds are only there to the conditions now this is why they 've got these laser got laser sights all over the body helmet and torso and the actual weapons got a laser on top and you get if you get near one of these things you go dead and your out and you can actually simulate . 
*PSUN:	0 .
