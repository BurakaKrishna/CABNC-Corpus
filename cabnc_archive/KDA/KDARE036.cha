*PS1GF:	That was probably the most the in the most interesting form friendship in there its fucking good I went for a job in there but I could n't I was an apprentice as I say that that 's what got me going really was the fact that he had to go down and actually do a design of the and he had to work on the . 
*PS1GE:	I think that 's technically a a draughtsman though is it that 's more like a more what we call a design commission .  38743_44353
*PS1GF:	Something like that yeah .  45203_47053
*PS1GE:	But everybody get it .  47053_48953
*PS1GF:	Yeah .  49393_49453
*PS1GE:	every but all all the draughtsman unless they were just called . 
*PS1GF:	We always used to play the like you never see what is going on and never know the problems involved in being that that was what was good about the the R A interview .  54453_73703
*PS1GE:	Yeah but they 're they 're much more keyed up probably their design programme is probably much more advanced than most other places .  73983_79903
*PS1GF:	The whole idea originally is the R A was to get them we can design as well . 
*PS1GE:	Yeah .  85973_86163
*PS1GF:	so I mean though I suppose that they probably had erm things they .  86163_93383
*PS1GE:	The the most efficient wing in the world is seven hundred mile an hour it it was a flying pig at at seven hundred and thirty .  99933_103633
*PSUN:	Ah ah sorry .  103633_104553
*PSUN:	0 . 
*PSUN:	Yeah .  104553_104613
*PSUN:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	Yeah like I said what 's what 's the people 's most efficient wing in the world seven hundred mile that could be a flying pig but why all of a sudden technology started in . 
*PS1GF:	See I do n't really know much about planes to be honest with you .  120173_122723
*PS1GE:	There there is planes but there is no want the the world 's most efficient because like I said that the efficiency changes at different different level .  122723_143883
*PS1GF:	Yeah .  143883_143973
*PS1GE:	speeds altitudes stuff like that .  143973_147383
*PS1GF:	See some different characteristics and a supersonic and so that then so the elevator and control services because at supersonic speeds if you moved at the same distance at six hundred mile an hour the elevator went like that so that sort of . 
*PS1GE:	0 . 
*PS1GF:	you 're not fucking throwing the plane out of control or the elevator would rip off or something I mean if you get the same sort of thing probably would only have to do that break the surface a little bit The we .  178283_191783
*PS1GE:	Think how much like .  191783_193003
*PS1GF:	we did two years theory as well no three years theory . 
*PS1GF:	There 's a there 's a lot of dead people not dead cos their dead because they 've died of old age dead because they were trying to find out how things work .  226753_242953
*PS1GE:	Yeah .  243243_243383
*PS1GF:	We flying a glider or throw themselves of the bridge if it does n't work they die somebody learns from that you know I know it it really was a fucking .  244023_260733

*PS1GF:	Let's face it a war is the the biggest single event that can increase technology in the electronics and radars two men on a fucking single budget two men on something like a three hundred pound a year budget or something silly .  278063_304363
*PS1GE:	Like behind us up behind where I live at Sandhurst thirty years now .  304363_310083
*PS1GF:	The prin I mean the principal of radar that 's fucking fascinating the did a programme on it . 
*PS1GE:	That 's that 's where they go on .  325743_326563
*PS1GF:	and the first sort of thing they ever had was just like a little screen it just went blip and that 's it all they could tell you was there was something in their vicinity it could n't tell you what direction it was or what height or anything .  326563_337253
*PS1GE:	That was developed up at .  337253_338733
*PS1GF:	Yeah and then from that they 've now got these fucking things that show the direction the sign the speed and oh its incredible sonar 's been going longer than radar but only just we were the world leader 's now I mean we cos we cos we preserve fuel we knew exactly they left it for the last minute to get up there and intercept them .  340353_374153
*PS1GE:	That 's right all of a sudden they 're . 
*PS1GF:	They reckon Germany done about ten fifteen minutes combat time over the over the .  383383_387193
*PS1GE:	only once who had any staying power with a high .  395783_401753
*PS1GF:	But then again they were no match to I mean we we say the In nineteen thirty there was something like there was only about er ninety hundred spitfires in the Battle of Britain all the rest were fucking Hurricane 's and stuff .  402303_449873
*PS1GE:	0 . 
*PS1GF:	Do they still do that .  450073_452163
*PS1GE:	No that 's been cut out same as the blue ribbon crossing the Atlantic blue ribbon event Even though even though er thingy trying to do ai n't they . 
*PS1GF:	The last the last the last liner oh yeah the last liner to actually do it is erm the Queen Mary 's .  471293_479653
*PS1GE:	say the Queen Mary .  480283_481593
*PS1GF:	I mean the Queen Elizabeth Q E two never even went into that like an average steamer thirty five knots or something .  484073_496453
*PS1GE:	Yeah .  496773_496843
*PS1GF:	that 's fucking going some for a ship that size I would love to have be able to fly with the or something .  497043_510733
*PS1GE:	yeah .  511383_511533
*PS1GF:	cos that really was flying you know that was no it was none of this fucking press a button and let the just a computer do it you 're a computer technician you 're a pilot now but this fucking Eddy Eddy the yeah real there 's there 's quite a few reputable .  511683_527573
*PS1GE:	Oh yeah .  528653_530583

*PS1GE:	Its only .  557653_557923
*PS1GF:	this is why they were so excited about this one they found in the Lock in the in er Loch Ness because it was in such superb condition and they actually reckon they can get it flying again .  557923_566973
*PS1GE:	its only one short as well Look at all the look at all the Brian called defiance ever heard of that then There 's only three yeah three they reckon left in the world and they found one with a Japanese .  568163_598053

*PSUN:	Yeah .  800893_800983
*PS1GF:	Supposed to be supposed to be the only one that does that .  801183_809253
*PS1GE:	No all helicopters fly backwards .  810193_825473
*PS1GF:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	Oh you mean loop the loop .  827973_831113
*PS1GF:	yeah they also fly backwards there .  831383_832983
*PS1GE:	oh they .  833093_833533
*PS1GF:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	there are two or three that can do it not many though that 's what I said two or three .  833923_840873
*PS1GF:	yeah that 's right .  840873_841853
*PS1GE:	technically if they get .  841853_843233
*PS1GF:	Yeah that that .  845623_846753
*PS1GE:	Oh yeah that 's the the erm .  847033_853043
*PS1GF:	the only one of its kind .  853053_854843
*PS1GE:	got a little jet outside .  854843_861323
*PS1GF:	jets at the back .  861323_862353
*PSUN:	What about .  864963_866143
*PS1GE:	no one I 've seen .  866143_873763
*PS1GF:	can do it .  873893_874793
*PS1GE:	the one I 've seen is the one without the tail ropers its just got a little jet out .  874793_885673
*PS1GF:	yeah .  886193_886263
*PS1GE:	stop the centre stop the erm lever .  886563_890433
*PS1GF:	This one had er a have a little ca n't remember what it was . 
*PS1GE:	Bells was the maker of it did a project on it .  902623_905033
*PS1GF:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	Gets you the reason why helicopters have n't been able to do loop the loop unless they 've got a lot of height is because obviously it pulls you up .  905413_929803
*PS1GF:	yeah .  930083_930233
*PS1GE:	so if you doing that doing that keep you up in the air right keep doing that you 'll go that way when the helicopter 's you want to do that way so obviously .  931383_957473
*PS1GF:	like that .  958393_958623
*PS1GE:	when its like that it tries and pulls you down and this is why there was an accident with a Wessex or something or a Sea King a while ago where three or four people died cos it just did n't get enough height and as as it got to the top it just pulled it straight down to the ground it could n't it did n't have enough height to clear the circle .  958623_983373
*PS1GF:	Was that a a Sea King or something about ten ten years ago or something try to do a a loop a loop air show and crashed .  983373_991913
*PS1GE:	I would n't .  992413_993163
*PS1GF:	it was one of these big things a Sea King or Wessex or something like that I remember I remember .  993483_1000033
*PSUN:	did n't really they should of .  1000033_1003303
*PS1GE:	that 's what I said it pulls them down erm the Apache can do it now at any height apparently erm and the there are there are two or three particular copter 's now .  1003303_1019813
*PSUN:	They 've got no .  1020243_1021153
*PS1GE:	pulls you up do that goes that way does that goes that way so you 're upside down you see you 've not only got weight and gravity pulling you down you 've also got the thrust of the engine pulling you down as well and the only way the helicopters going to be able to do it is by getting enough height so they can sort of drop like that and they start dropping and they can just pull it back . 
*PSUN:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	I remember it as I think I think I think I remember there was like three or four people inside it or something certainly was n't a .  1077013_1092013

*PS1GE:	they built they built a well beaten aircraft and they have n't got half the technical advantages that the West has and their computers has still practically just got out of the stage .

*PS1GE:	yeah .  1479173_1479743
*PS1GF:	but on the other hand you 've got the T eighty eight the T seventy two which is that 's only like the Correan one but its still got one of the the erm the longest range and the most accurate canons on any tank still I said the the Russian military 's got some of the best in the world and that 's giving the fact that they have n't yeah the the state of their population .  1479743_1504273
*PS1GE:	yeah exactly .  1504463_1504783
*PS1GF:	and I think where they .  1504943_1507083
*PS1GE:	cos they .  1507083_1507463
*PS1GF:	population starts getting that desperate that 's the time when we 've got to worry .  1507463_1512323
*PS1GE:	no .  1512323_1512513
*PS1GF:	the Russians are just just mad enough to fucking go for it .  1512513_1514583
*PS1GE:	no because they 'll do what they they 've always done there send their military in and they 'll they 'll say you are n't having this you are n't doing that I mean obviously Gorbachev 's I mean this stage he 'd just send the tanks in by now he plagued Yugoslavia crushed . 
*PS1GF:	so what happened to all this Yeltsin thing right has has it been so much build up speculation of the West you say thirty years of build up on our part is being wasted we 've really got nothing to fear of the Russians .  1538723_1553663
*PS1GE:	No I do n't think we have but I think they 'll probably be a Civil War first .  1553743_1558263
*PS1GF:	well yeah now but you you were saying this we we had this conversation when I 'd first got here before any of this started to happen .  1558453_1567113
*PS1GE:	I I I do n't think that you .  1567333_1568813
*PSUN:	Here you are .  1568813_1569473
*PS1GE:	we do n't really have anything to .  1569473_1574563
*PS1GF:	obviously we got to have fears because there 's something to be they 're the largest nation in fucking Europe so everybody 's got to fear them because they co-hearse all the other into being part of their group and that sort of stuff got ta be .  1574683_1591643
*PS1GE:	lets face it if if Russia had wanted to declare war to declared war on us sort of right ten years after the second World War had finished and that would of been it Europe would of been out . 
*PS1GF:	we always did .  1614873_1615803
*PS1GE:	because they were scared .  1615803_1616243
*PS1GF:	just because .  1616243_1616653
*PS1GE:	they were just as scared of us as we are of them .  1616653_1621503
*PS1GF:	nuclear weapons .  1621503_1621883
*PS1GE:	yeah exactly but other its not just that .  1621933_1624823
*PS1GF:	if we if there was no nuclear weapons I reckon we would of probably would of been at war with Russia now .  1624823_1632793
*PS1GE:	yeah that 's that is it that 's what I 've said er got there 's one reason one reason why .  1632863_1637273
*PS1GF:	but all these talks all these talks .  1637283_1638183
*PS1GE:	I would never of er voted Labour .  1638213_1641513
*PS1GF:	yeah cos its not a union that .  1641513_1643763
*PS1GE:	it is n't the biggest deterrent in the world backed by .  1643763_1648703
*PS1GF:	But like I said Mark er the mil nato never used to think that they can hold the Russian 's for very long in in conventional warfare 's . 
*PS1GE:	You 're telling me that we 've got nothing to fear from them .  1660313_1667363
*PS1GF:	ah see this this is one of .  1667363_1668273
*PS1GE:	why has there been such a Star Wars plan Why has there been such a a thing in the fifties and sixties for buying and that sort of stuff .  1668283_1676153
*PS1GF:	you you keep ca n't actually tell until it does happen until something does happen and then you know how well that each side is prepared .  1676153_1686253
*PS1GE:	All I know is that there are better people in that are more intelligent people that are better informed about than me or you and they deemed it that we 've got something to fear against and I 'm willing to take that .  1686253_1701033
*PS1GF:	Fear against .  1701033_1701193
*PS1GE:	Fear against them I still would n't put it past them I 'm not saying they will I 'd be very surprised if they did try to get cos they 're cos they 're on the sort of er the brink of being excepted by the rest of the world again you know but up until a couple of years ago this thing happened you know conventional warfare were and they only way we can stop them is by nuclear warfare 's . 
*PS1GF:	and you think part of the fear is er Russian causing the fear that communism is now spread three fold around the world .  1732403_1745133
*PS1GE:	Yeah you 're going on as if you started off on the fact that you do n't think we 've got any fear of them cos their kids are running round on the street and now all of sudden you say we have because they 've got nuclear weapons you say . 
*PS1GF:	No I I just said do you think after .  1767903_1769283
*PS1GE:	Oh yeah yeah .  1769373_1770233
*PS1GF:	by the which was .  1770553_1771063
*PS1GE:	0 . 
*PS1GF:	because one of state .  1771063_1772853
*PS1GE:	yeah I 'm saying it does yeah .  1772913_1775553
*PS1GF:	one minute shall forcibly put upon the world .  1775723_1779773
*PS1GE:	well yeah .  1780143_1780343
*PS1GF:	by force .  1780763_1780953
*PS1GE:	that 's why the the McCarthy witch hunt and stuff the hippies .  1780953_1782713
*PS1GF:	that there is that fear that is because that is the second World War this is why the erm the er late thirties early forties was never gon na succeed because they had two completely different archaeologist plus now in their purest form their not that but in the they were they were never going to work I mean that is the fact that their communists the sole reason they 've been against each other for a hundred and fifty years there is no other reason . 
*PS1GE:	0 . 
*PS1GF:	if they were capital capitalist you would n't have a problem . 
*PS1GE:	that 's why that 's ever since bolshevism first started in nineteen seventeen .  1835783_1840203
*PS1GF:	yeah exactly but I think er .  1840203_1843133
*PS1GE:	but then again since up up until the mid forties we had nothing to fear from the because they they did n't have much of an army themselves they had millions and millions of men but no resources or facilities to build it . 
*PS1GF:	The Germans feared them .  1856063_1857333
*PS1GE:	yeah because they had that that 's why .  1857333_1860323
*PS1GF:	shear weight of numbers .  1860363_1861073
*PS1GE:	that 's why that 's why during the first World War Germany made a categor categoric statement that Russia should start disarming she was mobilising . 
*PS1GF:	yeah but shear weight of numbers like I mean America America and Britain .  1868633_1875113
*PS1GE:	Red army .  1875113_1880403
*PS1GF:	American and Britain are partly responsible for the way the Russians are now cos we finance most of their industry in the second World War .  1880403_1887623
*PS1GE:	yeah that 's right but I mean what can you do I mean she was an Russian was a .  1887623_1893713
*PS1GF:	she wants the bear necessity .  1893713_1895003
*PSUN:	0 . 
*PS1GF:	All the reason that we have been against each other is because of economism and we we . 
*PS1GE:	but .  1901053_1901203
*PS1GF:	did did have and I 'll still say the only reason we have n't been at war with them is because of the army arm . 
*PS1GE:	oh yeah .  1913573_1914023
*PS1GF:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	0 . 
*PS1GF:	neutral wise yeah .  1914033_1914633
*PS1GE:	I was thinking venturialise as well I mean we ca n't we ca n't . 
*PS1GF:	we hoped to we could n't never hoped to match them .  1938223_1946843
*PS1GE:	during the second World War one German found three hundred four hundred Russians took them prisoner .  1946843_1950783
*PS1GF:	second World War .  1950783_1952523
*PS1GE:	yeah took them prisoner second single handed I mean .  1952723_1957713
*PS1GF:	After the second World War they did n't have a economy in the second World War now they have .  1958633_1965723
*PS1GE:	the Russian have fucking one of the most powerful forces I mean up until the Stalingrad in Moscow the the battle of Stalingrad they did n't know if they at all . 
*PS1GF:	They were wearing cardboard boots that froze in the winter .  1974523_1977973
*PS1GE:	yeah exactly .  1978123_1978933
*PSUN:	Yeah .  1979023_1979083
*PS1GE:	but I mean up until Stalingrad that was it the the Russian army was nothing right but as soon as Stalingrad came in every day . 
*PS1GF:	I ca n't see what the point is that was more than forty-five years ago . 
*PS1GE:	yeah what I 'm trying to say is that that the Germans on one German captured about four hundred blokes . 
*PS1GF:	what 's that got to do with modern day warfare and stuff .  1995883_2000823
*PS1GE:	well I do n't know .  2000913_2002313
*PS1GF:	its got nothing to do with it .  2002313_2003433
*PS1GE:	I know but what all going on is the history that fact is since the mid-fifties we we have had dealings cos they 've been one of the stronger of the world .  2003613_2012273
*PS1GF:	yeah no no nobody knows how how they how they do things they 've never opened up their army to us but .  2012273_2017943
*PS1GE:	I I do n't know how they get there but they know how our army works we know how their army works we can not hide manoeuvre 's and every army in the world knows the manoeuvre 's I 've been on one big nato manoeuvre out in Germany right and you 're saying to me they do n't know how I how each army works .  2017943_2038413
*PS1GF:	no I 'm saying that .  2038413_2038933
*PS1GE:	why why do military on our side say that we 'll gon na get fucked in conventional war we would hold them we would hold them .  2038933_2044443
*PS1GF:	shear weight of numbers .  2044453_2044793
*PS1GE:	for a year or two years .  2044933_2047623
*PS1GF:	shear weight of numbers .  2047623_2048253
*PS1GE:	yeah .  2048253_2048413
*PS1GF:	that 's all nothing else .  2048413_2048983
*PS1GE:	yeah matter why we 've got anything to do .  2048983_2051193
*PS1GF:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	if it was one on one we would n't have anything to do but it is the fact that they have got good technology good materials and they are that much more than us their troops are n't as well trained as ours . 
*PS1GF:	yes yes that 's that 's one of the class of .  2065643_2068683
*PS1GE:	their their supply routes are n't as well defined as ours but they 've got shear weight of numbers see I 'm af I 'm afraid I could be a fucking karate black belt or something right so one on one against you I would n't have a problem but if you went and got fucking thirty of your mates I would have a problem I maybe able to hold you off for a fucking few minutes or something or if you could either contact maybe a few months or years or something but they will win . 
*PS1GF:	yeah .  2094493_2094563
*PS1GE:	and this is why military strategies have always said we were gon na get we could hold them for a year two years maybe three but in the preventional warfare we would start loosing and military strategy have always said along that it would probably be somebody like France or us that would first use the nuclear weapon .  2094613_2112483
