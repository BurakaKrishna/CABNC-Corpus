*PS1GE:	Yeah basically .  1594273_1596883
*PS1GF:	between the fucking suppose to be are n't they .  1596883_1606763
*PS1GE:	0 . 
*PS1GF:	basically that the erm the trains that were right erm .  1606763_1613413
*PS1GE:	I thought they 'd taken it .  1613493_1618223
*PS1GF:	yeah but they take it they they got documentary have n't be able to get anybody died being shot they got people being brought back wounded and stuff but erm basically the there were I R A gunmen there erm at least three was spotted say in a crowd that size how many more went unspotted . 
*PS1GE:	yeah .  1645003_1645463
*PS1GF:	right its almost definite British come under fire but it does seem that the para 's did kill erm out of out of the thirteen only one had any I R A links he was a member of the the I R A erm and out of the remaining twelve only three of them might of fired a gun you know they leg or the hands by the side by the gun . 
*PS1GE:	yeah .  1679393_1679583
*PS1GF:	and er but apparently they did a they did a test and that was also a package where the stuff like that transfer although those three may of been carrying weapons they split open the policeman but this does seem to basically at well not no not indiscriminately they did n't say that but they shot innocent people I mean like I said well the I mean that 's got to kill in those streets and stuff the ricochet 's can go quite easily go through somebody but there there was there 's always been claims er there 's no I R A gunmen there .  1680703_1725073
*PS1GE:	yeah .  1725073_1725163
*PS1GF:	apart from one Reverend the most Reverend Doyle or something and he saw one gunmen and he saw him fire a couple of shots and they told him to piss off out of sort of thing . 
*PS1GE:	yeah .  1739203_1739393
*PS1GF:	so I mean if if they caught one they actually took a photo managed to take a photo out of all those hundreds of people look how many more were were there and it just seems like basically their not sure who fired first obviously the Irish say it was the British them and the British say they were fired upon first and erm on on the strength of it who who would you rather believe I mean somebody that 's been living in Ireland for twenty odd yea twenty years now with all that happening around him being able to be got at by the I R A or a British body who may may be up on a murder trial you know the at the end of the day its six of one and half a dozen of the other they 've both got stuffed by a bleeding troop . 
*PS1GE:	yeah .  1789523_1789763
*PS1GF:	so it really does think that all I .  1790603_1792903
*PSUN:	murder trial .  1792903_1795363
*PS1GF:	No they were that 's what they were were n't it when it all happened the old Revered somebody or other they wilful murder but erm yeah basically it does n't seem like there was no real evidence as to who erm fired first and there was no conclusion that the about that but they were certainly I R A gunmen para 's its like without a doubt if you know some people but like with those high powered weapons they may alright its unfortunately that somebody may have got shot but it may not of been the main shot that may may of been a ricochet or or anything like that both their they 've got a killing range of up to three mile so one mate come round he says he 's gon na come round again tomorrow and have a look at it . 
*PS1GE:	0 . 
*PS1GF:	well if they ring up tomorrow erm one bloke says he might ring up tomorrow one said she 'll she 'll come round at the weekend and another bloke said .  1883043_1894723
*PS1GE:	said it 's a Dolomite .  1895083_1930153
*PS1GF:	Dolomite its in the paper its in the paper for five-fifty but I told that lady last night is it what what is what 's what 's your minimum offer I said well I want four hundred for it I 'm not going to take any less so I was I was sort of and . 
*PS1GE:	0 . 
*PS1GF:	but erm I think I down by his legs all this and erm you know its bang bang its just like its over in a split second you do n't have time to be this I was there and there nobody really new what was going on and all this sort of stuff he was probably one of most honest about well one of the most honest little bloke more willing to speak about it and he had this other one it was right you know like er well I 'm already taking further than I 'm willing to go on this course what you need is well look you know all I know is that we was first saying no more than that not willing to go The only thing the only thing that all of us said categorically is they were fired upon first but the trouble is they 've had fucking twenty years to to think up their side and so there 's that so .  1952733_2009353
*PS1GE:	have n't they .  2009353_2010333
*PS1GF:	so have the Irish .  2010343_2011053
*PSUN:	0 . 
*PSUN:	How many they reckon fucking .  2011053_2013273
*PS1GE:	How many reckon shot them .  2013273_2020893
*PS1GF:	Yeah .  2021133_2021393
*PS1GE:	I do n't know well because I mean that any one of them could of said oh well we were being fired upon first and then they could of er their colleagues fucking going on .  2021393_2031693
*PS1GF:	Yeah but the other thing was it was n't that towards the end of the programme they were n't so much who fired first its erm there is there is no evidence either way to support either story the Irish say there was no Government there was nobody running for Government you know said that they had three .  2031973_2052603
*PS1GE:	If you can manage to get one photo of a gunmen in all that crowd how many more were there they did n't get a photo of you know erm so that 's bull shit for a start the said that they only fired upon identified targets going on motorbikes and erm I mean the thing is the para 's are a highly disciplined highly trained apparently at a you were n't even allowed to go out there without at least five years experience yeah they were soldiers they need and I ca n't believe that they negligibly you know cos there was women and children there and nearly all of them had wives and kids you know and there was reports from like the Irish saying oh yeah they were mixing body er care and body people and fucking laughing and joking over dead bodies and my old man said yeah if you just if you just seen something drop most people will laugh and joke about it you know I do n't know if you 've ever meet this sort of old man but the service sort of a a unique sense of they can laugh at anything you know they can see somebody with its guts put out in front of them and they 'll fucking crack out about it its the only way they can stop themselves cracking up or fucking crying sort of thing And there was this there was this no conclusive evidence the only the only thing that was that that these and make the said there was only one man definite I R A .  2052603_2164963
*PSUN:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	and the other may or may not of been like I said just the fact I 'm shaking your hand weapon he goes and does a frenzy test but the evidence on those three were was n't very was n't very conclusive and it .  2164963_2194483
*PS1GF:	So it does n't still does n't rule them out .  2195693_2197253
*PS1GE:	still does n't fit and that 's the thing yeah I mean all this morning was saying you have n't seen under fire they do n't stop and look around if they get down into cover he said how they suppose to know who 's firing or not you know .  2197283_2212753
*PS1GF:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	And he he said but we only .  2215013_2217723
*PS1GF:	You do n't fucking .  2217723_2218223
*PS1GE:	we had a couple of men fire over the .  2218232_2220193
*PS1GF:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	one of them said you know he said how how the hell how the hell can they say which directions the fire 's coming from but they I mean some of them were saying like this mate he run out he was going across this patch of open space and the soldier obviously saw a soldier and as he did that apparently he got shot through there and out the other side of him So the thing is if he inconsistent in that story if he 's doing that that direction how did he get shot from that way where he 's own telling stories apparently coming from .  2220193_2254223
*PS1GF:	Yeah .  2255293_2255483
*PS1GE:	You know that 's all right he may might alright there may of been a soldier there but they 've just come from that direction . 
*PS1GF:	yeah .  2261393_2261493
*PS1GE:	and then he 's he 's going out and they 're coming like that direction and he 's looked round and he 's seen the soldier doing it he 's gone and this is how I did it and then he put his like this and he stuck his hands up and as his done that he 's got shot through the body from the side what 's .  2261493_2274923
*PS1GF:	he still alive .  2275513_2276123
*PS1GE:	no he blew his chest out You do n't get and fucking live not many do any way .  2276343_2282393
*PSUN:	How did he know it was an S L R .  2282393_2285653
*PS1GE:	Ah .  2286003_2286113
*PSUN:	How did he know it was an S L R .  2286113_2289843
*PS1GE:	Well that 's it if if it was a British soldier it was a S L R .  2289963_2293183
*PSUN:	Yeah yeah that 's what I mean I mean he could of been fucking I R A .  2293183_2296813
*PS1GE:	Exactly the things they could of stop inside people unless its so you can never tell .  2296813_2302213
*PSUN:	Any one got any Harry .  2302213_2307183
*PSUN:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	But yeah I mean there was so so many inconsistencies on on the Irish witness side you know like what what matey said I was I was running out and all of a sudden I felt a pain from here on those fuck it he 's up there got big forearms and big sort of muscle that size that 's really wasted this side even after twenty years it must of about and apparently one matey got shot in the back running away oh no five out of the thirteen got shot in the back which again does n't fucking mean any thing you know that 's but I said if there 's I R A supporters there and that you telling me you seen where your comrades have fucking get shot you 're not you 're not gon na try and pick up his weapon and stuff I mean like it was just a perfect opportunity to to get one over on the British Forces and I I said I do n't think yet the para 's were entirely blameless but then again I do n't think they ever have been in any of their fucking . 
*PS1GF:	No .  2373353_2373443
*PS1GE:	they 're not angels they 're a hard regiment but they 're also highly disciplined and highly trained I 've got I I the other thing I could n't see what good I mean is it is it the I mean its not its not the anniversaries or any thing so I do n't know why they brought the out cos I ca n't see what interviewing people twenty years after the thing happen can do .  2374053_2392023
*PS1GF:	Not probably not .  2392363_2394063
*PS1GE:	Well well interesting programme I 'll give them that though .  2394603_2399603
*PS1GF:	Not a .  2399703_2403323
*PS1GE:	Yeah but my old man he 's a he 's driving he was driving the one of the that 's that erm Lieutenant Colonel was in at the time of the and he he was in there and he said my old man knows for certain that at that time they were under fire cos they drove in and picked up two bodies and put them in the back of the jeep all under fire . 
*PS1GF:	Yeah .  2431883_2432013
*PS1GE:	they know for a fact that there were gunmen there as to who shoot shot first that 's held in tribunal he could he he 'd never know . 
*PS1GF:	Who 's that your old man .  2440723_2442463
*PS1GE:	yeah nearly ever soldier that was there got Lord Rigdely or somebody you know .  2442463_2451433
*PSUN:	0 . 
*PS1GE:	yeah and er the the programme condemned him a bit basically he he did n't there was there was he did n't seemed to take in a lo a whole lot evidence from either side you know he did he did he did n't seemed to handle the case very well it was sort of more like it just get it over with quickly and forget it sort of thing . 
*PS1GF:	Sounds like .  2478043_2478303
*PS1GE:	I do n't know though I mean he he 's he 's allowed that he allowed that the fact that they could of been unarmed men and all that but he also condemned three of them on the evidence of this lead which he really should n't of done he should of left an open verdict on those few cos lead could be transferred to .  2479613_2502173
*PS1GF:	I mean lead can be picked up at what put your hand on the exhaust .  2502243_2506833
*PS1GE:	Oh well lead so er apparently if if you could get in fine detail enough we 'd have lead on ourselves this is why the this carbon dioxide stuff from the erm .  2506973_2517253
*PS1GF:	Fucking have that on the inside of the .  2517313_2523913
*PS1GE:	They have this they have this mp there from the S D L P from nineteen sixty-nine to seventy-two and he 's a a pacifist he went to the apparently he went to and spoke to the leader of the provisional I R A .  2523913_2540463
*PSUN:	no .  2540523_2540793
*PS1GF:	I do n't know who it .  2540793_2541693
*PS1GE:	I do n't know who it and apparently he asked him that are are any of your men gon na be there and if there are he said I 'm I 'm gon na pull out and use all my influence to stop the march and the I R A police said no there would not be any gunmen there so I thought yeah fucking right oh yeah that 's easy to say and then if like the reporter said and and you believe him and you have the feeble excuse towards a small community he said you know what 's going on .  2541703_2573703
*PS1GF:	fuck off .  2573703_2573953
*PS1GE:	exactly I mean this this is this is the I R A they 're not part of any fucking small community they are the fucking community unto themselves and that 's is that that was he 's answ erm that was he 's answer to the question of do do you believe him or something you know well all in all it was quite interesting . 
*PS1GF:	Oh it might .  2594373_2595063

*PSUN:	Do n't no nothing about it .  2662333_2664143
*PS1GE:	Thirteen thirteen supposedly are innocent Irish got killed by para 's by militaries included in the crowd and all the other 's the Irish say that basically there were no I R A gunmen there which is according to there 's proof that they have they were erm and like that the para It 's all a load of bull shit basically it seems it seems that the para 's were certainly under fire with nobody knows and erm it does the only thing that is blatantly clear all these lying transferred by the para 's and they were like dragging them away and stuff and the only there 's only one member that 's had any thing to do with the I R A that they can find out about that 's one so at least nine were n't firing definitely erm three may of done or may not of done so it looks like the only thing that basic the same is looks like at least nine were innocent you know its all right for .
